<h1>Praise for <em>Debugging Teams</em></h1>

<blockquote><p><em>"With honest clarity, Fitz and Ben have put together a manual for developing great products. But this is not a technical manual. Its key insight is that great products start (and end) with the people and organizations that build them. <span class="keep-together">A great read for makers of any stripe</span>."</em></p>

<blockquote><p><em>"This delicious book speaks to your inner geek! Even if you do not consider yourself a geek, the advice is worth the time to read anyway."</em></p>

    <p><em>"Software development is a team sport. If you want to become a top performer in the sport, there are hundreds of good books that tell you how to work on your individual skills as a software developer, and a few on how to be a good manager. This book breaks new ground by setting out all the key lessons for you as a software developer to learn how to work with your teammates, and how to be a good teammate. The field has needed a book like this for a long time, <span class="keep-together">and finally it has arrived</span>."</em></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>"I’ve been working with engineers for over 30 years, and in that time I’ve learned that engineering is as much about people as it is science and technology, but most engineers put little or no effort into understanding how to work with others. If you want to be more effective and efficient at creating and <span class="keep-together">innovating, then this book is for you</span>."</em></p>

<blockquote><p><em>"One of the top killers of early-stage companies is a bad cofounder dynamic. </em>Debugging Teams<em> is the self-help book for tech relationships. The expert advice inside will help you scale from a <span class="keep-together">team of 2 into a team of 20,000+</span>."</em></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote><p><em>“</em>Debugging Teams <em>is a manual on how to get work done at work, and its application is far broader than just engineering teams. It’s for all teams to understand the role that EQ, versus just IQ, plays in successful creation. This is a thoughtful, insightful, and very real read."</em></p>
    <p data-type="attribution">Amanda Lannert, CEO of Jellyvision</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Ben and Fitz have assembled an amazing collection of patterns and antipatterns for software development teams to consider. This book is for anyone struggling with understanding how to make such a team more productive—for the code wranglers themselves, for their managers, and for everyone in orbit around them. It puts down on paper many of the things innate to great open source developers. I wish I’d had this book years ago."</em></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"If you’re trying to build a team that is focused on shipping great software, then you need to read this book. Ben and Fitz do a great job of translating touchy-feely subjects like humility, respect, and trust into tactical suggestions that even the most skeptical developer can <span class="keep-together">appreciate</span>."</em></p>

<p><em>"This is a wonderful book. It deals with the hardest problem in computer programming, which is dealing with other computer programmers :-). I’ll be buying copies for all Samba team members."</em></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"You might have heard the aphorism ‘10X programmer,' describing the fact that top programmers are an order of magnitude more productive than average programmers. Making a big impact requires experience and powerful technical chops, but also empathy for your coworkers and users. No amount of smarts or knowledge can make up for a lack of the latter, but this book will help you hone your soft skills and leave an even bigger dent in the world."</em></p>

<blockquote><p><em>"In</em> Debugging Teams<em>, Fitz and Ben have drawn on their deep and broad experiences as highly regarded programmers to lay out, in a very readable and entertaining way, the keys to success for any sort of team-based creative endeavor—in other words, any company! It’s full of useful insights in areas related to leadership, collaboration, problem solving and communication. Anyone who cares about being more productive and more successful—in both their professional and their personal <span class="keep-together">lives—</span>will benefit from reading this book. It’s a great example of the power of combining analytics and human insights.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Fitz and Ben take a simple creed—Humility, Respect, and Trust—and cultivate that foundation with copious examples and stories. The experience and wisdom they share will help software engineers who work in teams—most of us—be more effective and productive."</em></p>

<blockquote> 
<p><em>"Software is made of people. A well-run team, using the principles outlined in</em> Debugging Teams<em>, can out-think, out-code, and out-ship any individual hacker. Coder, educate thyself!"</em></p>

<blockquote class="pagebreak-before">
<p><em>“</em>Debugging Teams <em>is</em> How to Win Friends and Influence People <em>for programmers. It’s full of clear and actionable advice on how to be more happy, productive, and effective on your technical team. Excellent and needed."</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Ben and Fitz come not to praise the myth of the lone programmer, but to bury it. They preside over its wake in a series of essays designed to teach right-brained engineers how to hack the most complex system they’ll ever encounter: people in a group.</em> Debugging Teams <em>shows that the most humane software is made by the best-functioning human teams—and how to achieve both."</em></p>

<p data-type="attribution">John Tolva, <span class="keep-together">Founder and President of PositivEnergy Practice</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
    <p><em>"This is a great book about the sociology of software development, with an emphasis on open source software and large corporations. The section on managing up and dealing with politics is essential reading for any new engineer in a corporate environment. I would recommend it to any engineer regardless of where he worked! This is the first book I’ve seen that covers office politics in an easily accessible fashion for engineers. The stories and anecdotes and practical tips on ‘How do you work with this difficult person?’ are gold! <span class="keep-together">You literally cannot buy this anywhere</span>."</em></p>

<blockquote class="pagebreak-before">
<p><em>“</em>Debugging Teams <em>is a gem of a book, in which Ben and Fitz share their very sensible philosophy of how programmers can best contribute to a good team. We are lucky that this important field is finally opened up for discussion with such warmth and humor. I wish that 21-year-old me had both a copy of the book and the good sense to take it to heart."</em></p>

<p data-type="attribution">Bryan O'Sullivan, Facebook</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"This book is a blueprint for building a healthy software development culture. It should be required reading for engineering managers, technical leaders, and even nontechnical executives who need to understand how team dynamics affect retention of top engineering talent and the quality of software they produce."</em></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"The skill of writing software will help you stay employed, but if you combine that with the ability to work well with others, you can change the world. This book isn’t just about how you can be a better programmer. It’s about how to be awesome."</em></p>

<p data-type="attribution">Clay Johnson, <span class="keep-together">Author of <em>The Information Diet</em></span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p><em>“</em>Debugging Teams <em>is an insightful exploration of building successful teams and products, taken from years of tackling difficult developer pains and issues that we all experience in our careers. The jovial approach to overcoming both engineering and human issues on a technical team delivers an engaging foundation text that should be a staple of every engineer’s library."</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Programming is no longer about code and machines, if it ever was. Increasingly, it’s about fitting together existing pieces in new ways—and each piece comes with people attached. The authors have understood this for years, and their message is as simple as their advice is varied: focus on the people as much as you focus on the code, and you will not only be a happier programmer, you will be the cause of happier programmers. It couldn’t come at a better time!"</em></p>

<blockquote class="pagebreak-before">
<p><em>"I’ve been blogging Ben and Fitz’s talks at conferences for years, because so few people address the social side of working with geeks. I’m excited to read the collective wisdom of their talks in one convenient book and not have to chase them around the country anymore."</em></p>
