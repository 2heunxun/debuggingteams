== Foreword to the Second Edition

The first edition of this book, __Team Geek__, proved to be a great
success.  In the four years since it was published there seems to be
more widespread recognition of the importance of teamwork in business.
In some places, collaboration is now being taught as part of college
curriculums and leadership training classes (often using our book!).

But we also came to realize that the first edition of the book was
perhaps a bit too focused on software engineering, so we've expanded
this second edition to be more accessible to a nontechnical audienceâ€”hence the title change to __Debugging Teams__.  While we still draw
on engineering examples, there's less focus on nitty-gritty details of
software development tools.  We've expanded and generalized a number
of our explanations throughout the book based on continuous feedback
from readers.  We've also added sections on more recent topics, such
as open seating plans, imposter syndrome, and newer communication and
leadership techniques.

We hope this expansion will have a broader appeal and impact across
multiple industries.
