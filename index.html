<p>The goal of this book is to help people spend more time creating and
less time fighting—by improving their ability to collaborate with
other people.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While there are two names on the cover, this book is the result of
conversations we&#8217;ve had with hundreds if not thousands of people over
the course of our lives and careers. We&#8217;d like to take a few moments
to thank just a few of the people who are responsible for many of the
useful parts of this book (mistakes, as usual, are all ours).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to the folks at O&#8217;Reilly Media: Mike Loukides for encouraging us to write for a broader audience, and our fearless editors Brian Anderson and Mary Treseler—this book wouldn&#8217;t
exist without Mary&#8217;s encouragement, patience, and occasional prodding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to Sunni Brown and Amber Lewis at
<a href="http://sunnibrown.com" class="bare">http://sunnibrown.com</a> for bringing our book to life with
such delightful illustrations—working with you guys was a true joy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to our technical reviewers who contributed numerous
suggestions, ideas, and fixes that really brought the book together:
Dustin Boswell, Trevor Foucher, Michael Hunger, Jonathan LeBlanc, Piaw
Na, and Jack Welch. Thanks to our friends and colleagues who reviewed
the book in progress and caught some of our more egregious mistakes:
Dave Baum, Matt Cutts, Will Robinson, and Bill Duane. Thanks to our
friends who listened, offered advice, and are just plain awesome: Karl
Fogel, Jim Blandy, Matt Braithwaite, Danny Berlin, and Chris
DiBona. Thanks also to Linda Stone, DeWitt Clinton, Bruce Johnson,
Roland McGrath, and Amit Patel for ideas and suggestions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to Google, and especially the Google Chicago engineering team,
for their support, ideas, and suggestions, and for just plain being a
fantastic group of people to work with every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks especially to some of our senior mentors and teachers, a tiny
bit of whose collective wisdom we&#8217;ve attempted to squeeze onto these
pages: Bill Coughran, Steve Vinter, Alan Eustace, Stu Feldman, and
Eric Schmidt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Special thanks to Brian Robinson and Yvonne Ellison-Sandler for their
mentoring, guidance, and tutelage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to the Apache Software Foundation, not only for having us, but
also for your focus on community and collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to all our close friends, who make us rich, rich men. Don&#8217;t
look at us that way—you know who you are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Huge swaths of this book were conceived, outlined, and written at the
fabulous, friendly, and cozy Filter Cafe in our fair city of Chicago.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="from_fitz">From Fitz</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Huge thanks to my wife Marie for her encouragement, understanding, and
patience—your insight and compassion are always an inspiration to
me. Thanks to my mom for her support and enthusiasm, and thanks
especially to my mother-in-law Rita Gumler, for her "people are like
plants" analogy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To Ben: after knowing each other for 16 years, working together at
three jobs, and writing three books together, I have to say that I
miss working with you every day. Thanks for taking this wild, weird,
and wonderful ride with me—you&#8217;ve been a great friend and teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, thanks to everyone that I&#8217;ve worked with in my (gulp) 21 years
in software engineering. It&#8217;s been an incredible journey, and not a
day has gone by where I didn&#8217;t learn something from one of you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="from_ben">From Ben</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There aren&#8217;t proper words to express my gratitude for the amount of
space my wife Frances has given me—not just in writing this book, but
in a dozen other creative projects I&#8217;ve taken on over the past few
years. Without her quiet and rocklike support, none of them could
possibly have happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To Fitz: now that we finish each other&#8217;s sentences I think it&#8217;s fair
to say we&#8217;re like a very old married couple. I never knew it could be
so much fun to give talks with somebody, let alone write software and
books together. What an amazing set of opportunities we&#8217;ve been given!
Thanks for teaching me so much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, thanks to all the crazy people and corporations of Silicon
Valley: none of these crazy experiences could have happened if you
hadn&#8217;t inducted me into your bizarro-world.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first edition of this book, <em>Team Geek</em>, proved to be a great
success.  In the four years since it was published there seems to be
more widespread recognition of the importance of teamwork in business.
In some places, collaboration is now being taught as part of college
curriculums and leadership training classes (often using our book!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But we also came to realize that the first edition of the book was
perhaps a bit too focused on software engineering, so we&#8217;ve expanded
this second edition to be more accessible to a nontechnical audience—hence the title change to <em>Debugging Teams</em>.  While we still draw
on engineering examples, there&#8217;s less focus on nitty-gritty details of
software development tools.  We&#8217;ve expanded and generalized a number
of our explanations throughout the book based on continuous feedback
from readers.  We&#8217;ve also added sections on more recent topics, such
as open seating plans, imposter syndrome, and newer communication and
leadership techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We hope this expansion will have a broader appeal and impact across
multiple industries.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Life is full of unexpected twists, and the two of us never imagined
we&#8217;d someday write a book about teamwork and collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like so many modern "makers," we discovered that our hobby and
passion—playing with computers—was a great way to make a living after
graduating college. And like most hackers of our generation, we spent
the mid-1990s building PCs out of spare parts, installing prerelease
versions of Linux from piles of diskettes, and learning to administer
Unix machines. At the dawn of the dot-com bubble we became
programmers, and after the bubble burst we started working for
surviving Silicon Valley companies such as Apple.  Later, we were
hired by a startup to work full time on designing and writing an open
source version control system called Subversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But something unexpected happened between 2000 and 2005. While we were
creating Subversion, our job responsibilities slowly changed. We
weren&#8217;t just writing code all day in a vacuum; we were leading an open
source project. This meant hanging in a chat room all day with a dozen
other volunteer programmers and paying attention to what they were
doing. It meant coordinating new features almost entirely through an
email list. Along the way, we discovered that the key to a project&#8217;s
success wasn&#8217;t just writing great code: the <em>way</em> in which people
collaborated toward the end goal mattered just as much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2005 we started Google&#8217;s Chicago engineering office and continued
our careers as programmers. At this point we were already deeply
involved with the open source world—not just Subversion, but the
Apache Software Foundation (ASF) too. We ported Subversion to Google&#8217;s
BigTable infrastructure and launched an open source project hosting
service (similar to SourceForge) under the banner of Google Code. We
began attending—then speaking at—developer-centric conferences such as
OSCON, ApacheCon, PyCon, and eventually Google I/O. We discovered that
by working in both corporations and open source projects we had
accidentally picked up a trove of wisdom and anecdotes about how real
software engineering teams work. What began as a series of humorous
talks about dysfunctional development processes ("Subversion Worst
Practices") eventually turned into talks about protecting teams from
jerks ("How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People"). Larger
and larger crowds gathered at our presentations in what can only be
described as "group therapy" for software developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After giving talk after talk about the social challenges of creative
collaboration, our editor at O&#8217;Reilly Media encouraged us to convert
the talks into a book.  The rest is history.</p>

<h3 id="who_is_this_book_for">Who Is This Book For?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book was originally written for software developers—for those who
are trying to advance their careers and ship great software.  But in
updating the book for a second edition, it has become clear to us that
the topics in this book apply to a much broader group.  If you work on
<em>any</em> sort of creative endeavor with other people, the lessons in
this book apply to you.  You might be part of a neighborhood club, a
church group, a fraternity, a committee, or a group of architects.
We&#8217;re assuming two important things about you as our reader:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You work on a team with other creative people, probably in a
corporate or other structured environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You enjoy building things and believe it should be a rewarding and
fun activity. If you&#8217;re cranking out products for no other reason
than to pay your bills, you probably aren&#8217;t interested in
self-actualization or career <span class="keep-together">fulfillment</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our own experiences come from software engineering, so predictably
most of the examples in this book live in that realm.  But nearly all
the processes and strategies we describe are directly applicable (or
have a direct analogue) to any team of creative people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the process of discussing how engineers best "play well with
others," we end up touching on a number of subjects that
(superficially) may seem to be out of a programmer&#8217;s job
description. At different points we discuss how to lead a team
effectively, navigate an organization, and build a healthy
relationship with the users of your software. On the surface these
chapters may seem specifically directed toward "people managers" or
"product managers"—but we assure you that at some point in your career
you&#8217;ll find yourself accidentally wearing those hats. Suspend your
disbelief and keep reading! Everything in this book is ultimately
relevant to anyone building things.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="warning_this_is_not_a_technical_manual">Warning: This Is Not a Technical Manual</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we start, we need to set your expectations. Motivated
programmers love to read books that lay out domain-specific problems
in a perfect mathematical presentation; each problem is typically
paired with a prescribed procedural solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not such a book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>Our book specifically investigates the <em>human</em> side of creative
product development, and humans are complex things. As we like to say
in our talks, "People are basically a giant pile of intermittent
bugs." Both the problems and solutions we discuss are messy and
difficult to place into perfect logical boxes. This book reads as a
series of essays, because that&#8217;s what it essentially is. In each
chapter we&#8217;ll discuss a slew of related problems (often as anecdotes),
then move on to discuss a group of solutions relevant to the overall
topic. To fully absorb everything you may need to lengthen your
attention span to cover multiple pages, engage your right brain to
make connections, or just plain sleep on it!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We should also make a couple more disclaimers. As we like to joke in
our talks, "These opinions are purely our own and are based on our
experiences. If you disagree, you&#8217;re welcome to get your own talk."
Just as with our oral presentations, we encourage any and all
discussion that arises from the topics in this book. We&#8217;re happy to
chat about feedback, corrections, new opinions, and disagreements: you
can find us at <a href="http://www.debuggingteams.com/" class="bare">http://www.debuggingteams.com/</a>. Everything in
this book comes from our own trials by fire and the lessons that came
out of our numerous mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should also know that every name used in our examples has been
changed to protect the innocent (or guilty).</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="the_contents_of_this_book_are_not_taught">The Contents of This Book Are Not Taught in School</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the software engineers we know have spent anywhere from 4
to 10 years in school learning about computer science and software
engineering. And yet there are hardly any
curricula <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> that
actually teach you how to communicate and collaborate in a team or a
company. Sure, most students are required to participate in a group
project at some point in their academic career, but there&#8217;s a big
difference between teaching someone how to successfully work with
another person and throwing him into a situation of forced
collaboration. Most students end up jaded by the experience.</p>

<h3 id="the_pitch">The Pitch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being a successful programmer isn&#8217;t just about learning the latest
languages or writing the fastest code. Professional coders almost
always work in teams, and it turns out that one&#8217;s team <em>directly</em>
affects that individual&#8217;s productivity and happiness more than many
people would like to admit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic idea of this book is simple: writing software is a team
sport, and we posit that the human factors involved have as much
influence on the outcome as the technical factors. Even if they&#8217;ve
spent decades learning the technical side of programming, most people
haven&#8217;t really focused on the human component. Learning to collaborate
is just as important to success. If you invest in the "soft skills" of
engineering, you can have a much greater impact for the same amount of
effort.</p>

<h2 id="the_myth_of_the_genius_programmer">The Myth of the Genius Programmer</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since this is a book about the social perils of creative development,
it makes sense to focus on the one variable you definitely have
control of: you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People are inherently imperfect. But before you can understand the
bugs in your coworkers, you need to understand the bugs in
yourself. We&#8217;re going to ask you to think about your own
reactions, behaviors, and attitudes—and in return, we hope you gain
some real insight into how to become a more efficient and successful
software engineer. You&#8217;ll end up spending less energy dealing
with people-related problems and more time writing great code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The critical idea in this chapter is to understand that software
development is a team sport. And in order to succeed on an engineering
team—or in any other creative collaboration—you need to reorganize
your behaviors around the core principles of humility, respect, and
trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we get ahead of ourselves, let&#8217;s start by observing how
programmers behave in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="help_me_hide_my_code">Help Me Hide My Code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two of us have been speaking at programming conferences quite a
bit for the past ten years. After launching Google&#8217;s open source
Project Hosting service back in 2006, we used to get lots of questions
and requests about the product. Back in mid-2008, we noticed a
distinctive trend in the sort of requests we were getting:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock pagebreak-before">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can you guys please give Subversion on Google Code the ability to
hide specific branches?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can you guys make it possible to create open source projects that
start out hidden to the world, then get revealed when they&#8217;re
ready?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hi, I want to rewrite all my code from scratch, can you please wipe
all the history?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can you spot a common theme to these requests?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answer is <em>insecurity</em>. People are afraid of others seeing and
judging their work in progress. In one sense, it&#8217;s just a part of
human nature—nobody likes to be criticized, especially for things that
aren&#8217;t finished. This attitude tipped us off to a trend within
software development. Insecurity is actually the symptom of a larger
problem.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="the_genius_myth">The Genius Myth</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two of us lived in Chicago throughout the 1990s and got to
witness the amazing run of championship wins by the Chicago Bulls. The
national media was saturated for years with stories about this amazing
basketball team. But what did TV and
newspapers really focus on? Not so much the team, but Michael
Jordan, the superstar. Every player around the
world wanted to <em>be</em> MJ. We watched him dance circles around other
players. We watched him in television commercials. We went to see
silly movies where he played basketball with cartoon characters. He
was a star, and every kid on every court practicing hoops secretly
wished to grow up and follow his path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many humans have the instinct to find and worship idols. For software engineers those might be Linus Torvalds, Guido Van Rossum, Bill Gates—all heroes who changed the world with heroic feats. Linus wrote Linux by himself, right?</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id002" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_01in01.png" alt="dbtm 01in01">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually, what Linus did was to write just the beginnings of a proof-of-concept Unix-like kernel, and show it to an email list. That was no small accomplishment, and it was definitely an impressive achievement, but it was just the tip of the iceberg. Linux is hundreds of times bigger than that and was developed by thousands of smart people. Linus’s real achievement was to <em>lead</em> these people and coordinate their work; Linux is the shining result not of his original idea, but of the collective labor of the community. (And Unix itself was not entirely written by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, but by a group of smart people at Bell Labs.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On that same note, did Guido Van Rossum personally write all of Python? Certainly, he wrote the first version. But hundreds of others were responsible for contributing to subsequent versions, including ideas, features, and bugfixes. Steve Jobs led an entire team that built the Macintosh, and while Bill Gates is known for writing a BASIC interpreter for early home computers, his bigger achievement was building a successful company around MS-DOS. Yet they all became leaders and symbols of the collective achievements of their communities. The Genius Myth is the tendency that we as humans have to ascribe the success of a team to a single person/leader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And how about Michael Jordan?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>It&#8217;s the same story. We idolize him, but the fact is that he
didn&#8217;t win every basketball game by himself. His true genius was
in the way he worked <em>with</em> his team. The team&#8217;s coach, Phil
Jackson, was extremely clever—his coaching
<span class="keep-together">techniques</span> are legendary: he recognized that one player alone never
wins a championship and so he assembled an entire "dream
team" around MJ. The team was a well-oiled machine—at least as
impressive as Michael himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So why do we repeatedly idolize the individual in these stories? Why
do people buy products endorsed by celebrities? Why do we want to buy
Michelle Obama&#8217;s dress or Michael Jordan&#8217;s shoes?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Celebrity is a big part of it. Humans have a natural instinct to
locate leaders and role models, idolize them, and attempt to imitate
them. We all need heroes for
inspiration, and the programming world has its heroes too. The
phenomenon of "techie-celebrity"
has almost spilled over into mythology. We all want to write something
world-changing like Linux or design the next brilliant programming
language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deep down we all secretly wish to be geniuses. The ultimate geek fantasy is to be struck by an awesome new concept. You
go into your Batcave for weeks or months, slaving away at a perfect
implementation of your idea. You then "unleash" your
software on the world, shocking everyone with your genius. Your peers
are astonished by your cleverness. People line up to use your
software. Fame and fortune follow naturally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But hold on: time for a reality check. You&#8217;re probably not a genius.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No offense, of course—we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re a very intelligent
guy or gal. But do you realize how rare <em>actual</em> geniuses really
are? Sure, you write code, and that&#8217;s a tricky skill that
probably puts you in a bracket above a lot of the human
population. But even if you are a genius, it turns out that
<em>that&#8217;s not enough</em>. Geniuses still make mistakes, and having
brilliant ideas and elite programming skills doesn&#8217;t guarantee
that your software will be a hit. What&#8217;s going to make or break
your career is how well you collaborate with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that this Genius Myth is just
another aspect of our insecurity. Most programmers are afraid to share
work they&#8217;ve only just started, because it means peers will see
their mistakes and know the author of the code is <em>not a genius</em>. To
quote a programmer from Ben&#8217;s blog:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock pagebreak-before">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know I get SERIOUSLY insecure about people looking before
something is done. Like they are going to seriously judge me and think
I&#8217;m an idiot.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an extremely common feeling among programmers, and the natural
reaction is to hide in a cave and work, work, work. Nobody will see
your goof-ups; you still have a chance to unveil your masterpiece when
you&#8217;re done. Hide away until all of it is perfect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another common motivation for holding your cards close to your chest
is the fear that another programmer might take your idea and run with
it before you get around to working on it. By keeping it secret, you
control the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We know what you&#8217;re probably thinking now: so what?
Shouldn&#8217;t people be allowed to work however they want?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually, no. In this case we assert that you&#8217;re doing it wrong,
and it <em>is</em> a big deal. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="hiding_is_considered_harmful">Hiding Is Considered Harmful</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you spend all your time working alone, you&#8217;re <em>increasing</em>
the risk of failure and cheating your potential for growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, how do you even know if you&#8217;re on the right track?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re a bicycle-design enthusiast, and one day you get
a brilliant idea for a completely new way to design a gear
shifter. You order parts and proceed to spend weeks holed up in your
garage trying to build a prototype. When your neighbor—also a bike
advocate—asks you what&#8217;s up, you decide not to talk about
it. You don&#8217;t want anyone to know about your project until
it&#8217;s absolutely perfect. Another few months go by and
you&#8217;re having trouble making your prototype work correctly. But
because you&#8217;re working in secrecy, it&#8217;s impossible to
solicit advice from your mechanically inclined
friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then one day your neighbor pulls his bike out of his garage with a
radical new gear-shifting mechanism. Turns out he&#8217;s been
building something very similar to your invention, but with the help
of some friends down at the bike shop. At this point you&#8217;re
exasperated. You show him your work. He points out that your design
had some simple flaws—ones that might have been fixed in the first
week if you had shown him.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id003" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_01in02.png" alt="dbtm 01in02">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of lessons to learn here. If you keep your great
idea hidden from the world and refuse to show anyone anything until
the implementation is polished, you&#8217;re taking a huge
gamble. It&#8217;s easy to make fundamental design mistakes early
on. You risk reinventing wheels.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> And you forfeit the benefits of
collaboration too: notice how much faster your neighbor moved by
working with others? This is why people dip their toes in the water
before jumping in the deep end: you need to make sure that
you&#8217;re working on the right thing, you&#8217;re doing it
correctly, and it hasn&#8217;t been done before. The chances of an
early misstep are high. The more feedback you solicit early on, the
more you lower this risk.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>
Remember the tried-and-true mantra of "Fail early, fail fast,
fail often"—we&#8217;ll discuss the importance of failure at length later in the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early sharing isn&#8217;t just about preventing personal missteps and
getting your ideas vetted. It&#8217;s also important to strengthen
what we call the <em>bus factor</em> of your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Bus factor</em> (noun): the number of people that need to get hit by a
bus before your project is completely doomed.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id004" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_01in03.png" alt="dbtm 01in03">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How dispersed is the knowledge and know-how in your project? If
you&#8217;re the only person who understands how the prototype
code works, it may be
nice job security, but it also means the project is toast if you get
hit by a bus. If you&#8217;re working with a friend, however,
you&#8217;ve doubled the bus factor. And if you&#8217;ve got a small
team designing and prototyping together, things are even better—the
project won&#8217;t be over when a team member disappears. Remember:
team members may not literally get hit by buses, but other
unpredictable life events still happen. Someone may get married, have
to move away, leave the company, or have to take care of a sick
relative. You need to future-proof a project&#8217;s success by
managing the bus factor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond the bus factor, there&#8217;s the issue of overall pace of progress. It&#8217;s easy to forget that working
alone is often a tough slog, much slower than people want to
admit. How much do you learn when working alone? How fast do you move?
The Web is a great dumping ground of opinions and information, but
it&#8217;s no substitute for actual human experience. Working with
other people directly increases the collective wisdom behind the
effort. When you get stuck on something absurd, how much time do you
waste pulling yourself out of the hole? Think about how different the
experience would be if you had a couple of peers to look over your
shoulder and tell you—instantly—how you goofed and how to get past the
problem. This is exactly why teams sit together (or do pair
programming) in software engineering companies: you often find
yourself needing a second pair of eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s another analogy. Think about how you work with your
compiler. When you sit down to write a large piece of software, do you
spend days writing 10,000 lines of code, then when you think it&#8217;s all done and
completely perfect, press the "compile" button for the very first
time? Of course you don&#8217;t. Can you imagine what sort of disaster would
result?  As
programmers we work best in
<em>tight</em> feedback
loops. Write a new function, compile. Add a test, compile. Refactor
some code, compile. We get the typos and bugs fixed as soon as
possible after generating code. We want the compiler at our side for
every little step, playing wingman; some environments can even compile
our code <em>as we type</em>. This is how we keep code quality high and
make sure our software is evolving correctly bit by
bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same sort of rapid feedback loop is needed not just at the code
level, but at the whole-project level too. Ambitious projects evolve
quickly and have to adapt to changing environments as they
go. Projects run into unpredictable design obstacles or political
hazards, or we simply discover that things aren&#8217;t working as
planned. Requirements morph unexpectedly. How do you get that feedback
loop so that you know the instant your plans or designs need to
change? Answer: by working in a team. Eric Raymond is often quoted as
saying, "Many eyes make all bugs shallow," but a better version might

<div class="title">Engineers and Offices</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Twenty years ago conventional wisdom stated that for an engineer to be
productive, she needed to have her own office with a door that
closed. This was supposedly the only way she could have big
uninterrupted slabs of time to deeply concentrate on writing reams of
code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We think that it&#8217;s not only unnecessary for most engineers<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup> to be in a private office, it&#8217;s dangerous. Software
today is written by teams, not individuals, and a high-bandwidth,
readily available connection to the rest of your team is even more
valuable than your Internet connection. You can have all the
uninterrupted time in the world, but if you&#8217;re using it to work
on <em>the wrong thing</em>, you&#8217;re wasting your time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that modern-day tech companies have swung the
pendulum to the exact opposite extreme.  Walk into their offices and
you&#8217;ll often find engineers clustered together in massive <span class="keep-together">rooms—</span>50
or 100 people together—with no walls whatsoever.  This "open floor
plan" is now a topic of huge debate.  The tiniest conversation becomes
public, and people end up not talking for risk of annoying dozens of
neighbors.  This is just as bad as private offices!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We think the middle ground is really the best solution.  Group teams
of 6 to 12 people together in small rooms (or large offices), so as to
make it easy (and nonembarrassing) for spontaneous conversation to
happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, in any situation, individual engineers still need a way to
filter out noise and interruptions, which is why most teams we&#8217;ve seen
have developed a way to communicate that they&#8217;re currently busy and
that you should limit interruptions. We used to work on a team with a
vocal interrupt protocol: if you
wanted to talk, you would say "breakpoint <em>Mary</em>," where <em>Mary</em> was
the name of the person you wanted to talk to. If Mary was at a point
where she could stop, she would swing her chair around and listen. If
Mary was too busy, she&#8217;d just say "ack" and you&#8217;d go on with other
things until she finished with her current head state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other teams give out noise-canceling headphones to engineers to make
it easier to deal with background noise—in fact, in many companies the
very act of wearing headphones is a common signal that means "don&#8217;t
disturb me unless it&#8217;s really important." Still other teams have
tokens or stuffed animals that team members put on their monitor to
signify that they should be interrupted only in case of emergency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t misunderstand us—we still think engineers need
uninterrupted time to focus on writing code, but we think they need a high-bandwidth,
low-friction connection to their team just as much.  Finding the right
balance is an art.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>So what it boils down to is this: <em>working alone is inherently
riskier than working with others</em>. While you may be afraid of someone
stealing your idea or thinking you&#8217;re dumb, you should be much
more scared of wasting huge swaths of your time toiling away on the
wrong thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sadly, this problem of "clutching ideas to the chest"
isn&#8217;t unique to software engineering—it&#8217;s a pervasive
problem across all fields. For example, professional science is
<em>supposed</em> to be about the free and open exchange of
information. But the desperate need to "publish or perish"
and to compete for grants has had exactly the opposite effect. Great
thinkers don&#8217;t share ideas. They cling to them obsessively, do
their research in private, hide all mistakes along the path, and then
ultimately publish a paper, making it sound like the whole process was
effortless and obvious. And the results are often disastrous: they
accidentally duplicated someone else&#8217;s work, or they made an
undetected mistake early on, or they produced something that used to
be interesting but is now regarded as useless. The amount of wasted
time and effort is tragic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t become another statistic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="its_all_about_the_team">It&#8217;s All About the Team</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So let&#8217;s back up now and put all these ideas together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point we&#8217;ve been hammering is that in the realm of
programming, lone craftsmen are extremely rare—and even when they do
exist, they don&#8217;t perform superhuman achievements in a vacuum;
their world-changing accomplishment is almost always the result of a
spark of inspiration followed by a heroic team effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a superstar <em>team</em> is the real goal, and is fiendishly
difficult. The best teams make brilliant use of their superstars, but
the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s put this idea into simpler words:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Software development is a team sport</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may be a difficult concept at first, since it directly
contradicts our inner Genius Programmer fantasy. Try chanting it as a
mantra.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not enough to be brilliant when you&#8217;re alone in your
hacker&#8217;s lair. You&#8217;re not going to change the world or
delight millions of computer users by hiding and preparing your secret
invention. You need to <em>work</em> with other people. Share your
vision. Divide the labor. Learn from others. Create a brilliant
team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider this: how many pieces of widely used, successful software can
you name that were truly written by a <em>single</em> person? (Some people
might say "LaTeX," but it&#8217;s hardly "widely
used," unless you consider the number of people writing
scientific papers to be a statistically significant portion of all
computer users!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re going to repeat this team-sport concept over and over
throughout the book. High-functioning teams are gold and the true key
to success. You should be aiming for this experience however you can;
that&#8217;s what this book is all about.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="the_three_pillars">The Three Pillars</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the point about working in teams has been made. If teamwork is the best route to
producing great software, how does one build (or find) a great
team?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not quite that simple. In order to reach collaborative
nirvana, you first need to learn and embrace what we call the
"three pillars" of social skills. These three principles aren&#8217;t just about greasing the
wheels of relationships; they&#8217;re the foundation on which all
healthy interaction and collaboration are based.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Humility</dt>
<dd>
<p>    You are not the center of the universe. You&#8217;re neither
omniscient nor infallible. You&#8217;re open to self-improvement.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Respect</dt>
<dd>
<p>You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them as
human beings, and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Trust</dt>
<dd>
<p>You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and
you&#8217;re OK with letting them drive when
appropriate.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Together, we refer to these principles as HRT. We pronounce this as "heart"
and not "hurt" because it&#8217;s all about <em>decreasing</em>
pain and not about injuring people. In fact, our main thesis is built
directly on these pillars:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost every social conflict can ultimately be traced back to a lack
of humility, respect, or trust.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may sound implausible at first, but give it a try. Think about some
nasty or uncomfortable social situation in your life right now. At the
basest level, is everyone being appropriately humble? Are people
really respecting one another? Is there mutual trust?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We believe these principles are so important that we&#8217;ve even
structured this book around them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book begins with you: getting you to embrace HRT and really
internalize what it means to put HRT at the center of your
interactions. That&#8217;s what this first chapter is about. From
there we create ever-expanding circles of influence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#building_an_awesome_team_culture">Building an Awesome Team Culture</a> we discuss the challenge of
building a team based on the three pillars. Creating a team culture is
the critical next step to success—this is the "dream team"
discussed earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then examine people who are interacting with your team on a daily
basis, but may not be part of the core team culture. These may be
coworkers from other teams, or just volunteers offering to help on
your project. Many of them not only disregard HRT, but they can be downright
poisonous! Learning to defend your team from them is the first order
of business. Removing their fangs and sucking them into your culture
should be the ultimate goal, however. It&#8217;s a great way to expand
a team.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id006" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_01in05.png" alt="dbtm 01in05">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most teams work within a larger company, and this environment can
often be just as much of an impediment as poisonous people. Learning
how to navigate these organizational obstacles can be the difference
between launching a product and getting that very same product
canceled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we consider the users of your software. Sometimes we forget
they exist, but they are the lifeblood of your project. Without users,
your software has no purpose. The same HRT principles that thrive in your team can and
should be applied to the way you interact with your users, and the
benefits reaped are <span class="keep-together">tremendous</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s pause for a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you picked up this book, you probably weren&#8217;t thinking you
were signing up for some sort of weekly support group. We
empathize. Dealing with social problems can be difficult. People are
messy, unpredictable, and often annoying to interface with. Rather
than putting energy into analyzing social situations and making
strategic moves, it&#8217;s tempting to write off the whole
effort. It&#8217;s much easier to hang out with a predictable
compiler, isn&#8217;t it? Why bother with the social stuff at all?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from a famous lecture by
Richard Hamming:<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By taking the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being a
little friendly, I got superb secretarial help. For instance, one time
for some idiot reason all the reproducing services at Murray Hill were
tied up. Don&#8217;t ask me how, but they were. I wanted something
done. My secretary called up somebody at Holmdel, hopped [into] the
company car, made the hour-long trip down and got it reproduced, and
then came back. It was a payoff for the times I had made an effort to
cheer her up, tell her jokes and be friendly; it was that little extra
work that later paid off for me. By realizing you have to use the
system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn
how to adapt the system to your desires.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The moral is this: do not underestimate the power of playing the
social game. It&#8217;s not about tricking or manipulating people;
it&#8217;s about creating relationships to get things done, and
relationships <em>always</em> outlast projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="hrt_in_practice">HRT in Practice</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this preaching about humility, respect, and trust sounds like
sermon material. Let&#8217;s come out of the clouds and think about
how to apply these ideas in real-life situations. We&#8217;re looking
for practical suggestions and so we&#8217;re going to examine a list
of specific behaviors and examples you can start with. Many of them
may sound obvious at first, but once you start thinking about them
you&#8217;ll notice how often you (and your peers) are guilty of
<em>not</em> following them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3 pagebreak-before">
<h4 id="lose_the_ego">Lose the Ego</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, this is sort of a simpler way of telling someone without enough
<em>humility</em> to lose his &#x2019;tude. Nobody wants to work with someone who
consistently behaves like he&#8217;s the most important person in the
room. Even if you know you&#8217;re the wisest person in the
discussion, don&#8217;t wave it in people&#8217;s faces. For example,
do you always feel like you need to have the first or last word on
every subject? Do you feel the need to comment on every detail in a
proposal or discussion? Or do you know somebody who does these
things?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that "being humble" is <em>not</em> the same as saying one should be
an utter doormat: there&#8217;s nothing wrong with self-confidence. Just
don&#8217;t come off like a know-it-all. Even better, think about going for
a "collective" ego instead; rather than worrying about whether you&#8217;re
personally awesome, try to build a sense of team accomplishment and
group pride. For example, the Apache Software Foundation has a long
history of creating communities around software projects; these
communities have incredibly strong identities and reject people who
are more concerned about self-promotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ego manifests itself in many ways, and a lot of the time it can get
in the way of your productivity and slow you down. Here&#8217;s
another great story from Hamming&#8217;s lecture that illustrates this
point perfectly:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John Tukey almost always dressed very casually. He would go
into an important office and it would take a long time before the
other fellow realized that this is a first-class man and he had better
listen. For a long time John has had to overcome this kind of
hostility. It&#8217;s wasted effort! I didn&#8217;t say you should
conform; I said, "The appearance of conforming gets you a long
way." If you chose to assert your ego in any number of ways, "I
am going to do it my way," you pay a small steady price
throughout the whole of your professional career. And this, over a
whole lifetime, adds up to an enormous amount of needless trouble. […]
By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get
the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your
desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small, undeclared war, for
the whole of your life.</p>

<h4 id="learn_to_both_deal_out_and_handle_critic">Learn to Both Deal Out and Handle Criticism</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Joe started a new job as a programmer. After his first week he really
started digging into the code base. Because he cared about what was
going on, he started gently questioning other teammates about their
contributions. He sent simple code reviews by email, politely asking
about design assumptions or pointing out places where logic could be
improved. After a couple of weeks he was summoned to his
director&#8217;s office. "What&#8217;s the problem?" Joe
asked. "Did I do something wrong?" The director looked
concerned: "We&#8217;ve had a lot of complaints about your
behavior, Joe. Apparently you&#8217;ve been really harsh toward your
teammates, criticizing them left and right. They&#8217;re upset. You
need to tone it down." Joe was utterly baffled. In a strong
culture based on HRT, Joe&#8217;s code reviews should have been welcomed and
appreciated by his peers. In this case, however, Joe should have been
more sensitive to the team&#8217;s widespread insecurity and should
have used subtler means to introduce code reviews into the
culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Criticism is almost never
personal in a professional software engineering environment—it&#8217;s
usually just part of the process of making a better product. The trick
is to make sure you (and those around you) understand the difference
between constructive criticism of
someone&#8217;s creative output and flat-out assaults against
someone&#8217;s character. The latter is useless—it&#8217;s petty and
nearly impossible to act on. The former is always helpful and gives
guidance on how to improve. And most importantly, it&#8217;s imbued
with <em>respect</em>: the person giving the constructive criticism genuinely cares about the
other person and wants her to improve herself or her work. Learn to
respect your peers and give constructive criticism politely. If you
truly respect someone, you&#8217;ll be motivated to choose tactful,
helpful phrasing—a skill acquired with much
practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other side of the conversation, you need to learn to accept
criticism as well. This means not just being <em>humble</em> about your
skills, but <em>trusting</em> that the other person has your best interests
(and those of your project!) at heart and doesn&#8217;t actually think
you&#8217;re an idiot. Programming is a skill like anything else. It
improves with practice. If a peer pointed out ways in which you could
improve your juggling, would you take it as an attack on your
character and value as a human being? We hope not. In the same way,
<em>your self-worth shouldn&#8217;t be connected to the code you write—or
any creative project you build</em>. To repeat ourselves: you are not
your code. Say that over and over. <em>You are not what you make</em>. You
need to not only believe it yourself, but get your coworkers to
believe it too.</p>

<p>For example, if you have an insecure collaborator, here&#8217;s what <em>not</em>
to say: "Man, you totally got the control flow wrong on that method
there. You should be using the standard xyzzy code pattern like
everyone else." This feedback is full of antipatterns: you&#8217;re telling
someone he&#8217;s "wrong" (as if the world were black and white!),
demanding he change something, and accusing him of creating something
that goes against what everyone else is doing (making him feel
stupid). The response is going to be overly emotional, coming from
someone put on the defense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A better way to say the same thing might be, "Hey, I&#8217;m
confused by the control flow in this section here. I wonder if the
xyzzy code pattern might make this clearer and easier to
maintain?" Notice how you&#8217;re using humility to make the
question about you, not him. He&#8217;s not wrong; you&#8217;re just
having trouble understanding the code. The suggestion is merely
offered up as a way to clarify things for poor little you, and
possibly helping the project&#8217;s long-term sustainability
goals. You&#8217;re also not demanding anything—you&#8217;re giving
your collaborator the ability to peacefully reject the suggestion. The
discussion stays in the realm of the code itself and isn&#8217;t about
anyone&#8217;s value or coding skills.</p>

packing up his desk, and when he gets the inevitable "the CEO

<p>At Google, one of our favorite
mottoes is "Failure is an option." It&#8217;s widely
recognized that if you&#8217;re not failing now and then, you&#8217;re not being
innovative enough or taking enough risks. Failure is viewed as a
golden opportunity to learn and improve for the next go-around. In
fact, Thomas Edison is often quoted as saying,
"If I find 10,000 ways something won&#8217;t work, I haven&#8217;t failed. I am
not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step
forward."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over in Google X—the division that works on "moonshots" like
Google Glass and self-driving cars—failure is deliberately built
into their incentive system.  People come up with crazy ideas and
coworkers are actively encouraged to shoot them down as fast as
possible.  Individuals are rewarded (and even compete!) to see how
many ideas they can disprove or invalidate in a fixed period of time.
When a concept is truly unable to be debunked at a whiteboard by all
peers, only <em>then</em> does it proceed to early prototype.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key to learning
from your mistakes is to document your failures. Write up
"postmortems," as they&#8217;re often
called in our business. Take extra care to make sure the postmortem
document isn&#8217;t just a useless list of apologies or
excuses—that&#8217;s not its purpose. A proper postmortem should
always contain an explanation of <em>what was learned</em> and <em>what is
going to change</em> as a result of the learning experience. Then make
sure you put it in an easy-to-find place and really follow through on
the proposed changes. Remember that properly documenting failures also
makes it easier for other people (present and future) to know what
happened and avoid repeating history. Don&#8217;t erase your
tracks—light them up like a runway for those who follow you!</p>

<p>Cindy was a superstar—a software engineer who had truly mastered her
specialized area. She was promoted to technical lead, saw her responsibilities increase, and rose to the challenge. Before long,
she was mentoring everyone around her and teaching them the ropes. She
was speaking at conferences on her subject and pretty soon ended up in
charge of multiple teams. She absolutely loved being the
"expert" all the time. And yet, she started to get
bored. Somewhere along the way she stopped learning new things. The novelty of being the
wisest, most experienced expert in the room started to wear
thin. Despite all of the outward signs of mastery and success,
something was missing. One day she got to work and realized that her
chosen field simply wasn&#8217;t so relevant anymore; people had moved
on to other topics of interest. Where did she go wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: it is <em>fun</em> to be the most knowledgeable person
in the room, and mentoring others can be incredibly rewarding. The
problem is that once you reach a local maximum on your team, you stop
learning. And when you stop learning, you get
bored. Or accidentally become obsolete. It&#8217;s really easy to get
addicted to being a leading player; but only by giving up some ego
will you ever change directions and get exposed to new things. Again,
it&#8217;s about increasing <em>humility</em> and being willing to learn as

resulted in some epic interpersonal conflicts, disagreements, and the
occasional heated argument.  It got to the point where the two of them
simply couldn&#8217;t pair-program together: it was too frustrating for both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, the two of them had a longstanding history of trust and
respect for each other.  Combined with patience, this helped them work out a new
method of collaborating.  They would sit together at the computer,
identify the bug, and split up and attack the problem from two
directions at once (top-down and bottom-up), then come back together
and meet in the middle with their findings.  Their patience and
willingness to improvise new working styles not only saved the
project, but also saved the friendship.</p>

<h4 id="be_open_to_influence">Be Open to Influence</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more you are open to influence, the more you
are able to
influence; the more vulnerable you are, the stronger you appear. These
statements sound like bizarre contradictions. But everyone can think
of someone they&#8217;ve worked with who is just maddeningly
stubborn. No matter how much people try to persuade him, he digs his
heels in even more. What eventually happens to such team members? In
our experience, they end up just getting "routed around"
like an obstacle everyone takes for granted. People stop listening to
their opinions or objections. You certainly don&#8217;t want that
happening to you, so keep this idea in your head: it&#8217;s OK for
someone else to change your mind. Choose your battles
carefully. Remember that in order to be heard properly, you first need
to listen to others. In the case of being influenced, this listening
should take place before you&#8217;ve put a stake in the ground or
firmly declared that you&#8217;ve decided on something—if you&#8217;re
constantly changing your mind, people will think you&#8217;re
wishy-washy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the subject of vulnerability, this seems a bit strange at first
too. If someone admitted she was ignorant of the topic at hand or
didn&#8217;t know how to solve a problem, what sort of credibility
would she have in a group? Vulnerability is a show of weakness, and
that destroys trust, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not true. Admitting you&#8217;ve made a mistake or you&#8217;re simply
out of your league is a way to <em>increase</em> your status over the long
run. In fact, it encompasses all of HRT: it&#8217;s an outward show of
<em>humility</em>, it&#8217;s about accountability and taking
responsibility, it&#8217;s a signal that you <em>trust</em> others'
opinions, and in return, people end up <em>respecting</em> your honesty and
strength. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just say, "I
don&#8217;t know."</p>

say. This behavior exists primarily because politicians are constantly
under attack by their opponents. When you&#8217;re writing software,

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Team cultures are incredibly varied and reflect a wide range of values
and priorities. Some promote team success, and others promote team
failure on a grand scale. However, even among the cultures that lead
to successful teams, some are incredibly efficient and focus the
majority of your team&#8217;s effort on the work they set out to do, while
others provide a great deal of distraction from the task at hand. In
this chapter we&#8217;ll talk about culture, with a strong focus on various
communication techniques that contribute to success. We&#8217;ll identify
how these techniques can be used to create any product more efficiently
with a team of humans.</p>

<h3 id="what_is_culture">What Is Culture?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you hear the word <em>culture</em>, your thoughts typically wander to
either an evening at the opera or the dish of jelly growing bacteria
that you had back in high school biology. It turns out that
engineering team culture isn&#8217;t all that different from the latter.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id009" class="imageblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had a really delicious piece of sourdough bread and
took the time to hunt down the person who baked it, you would find
that the key ingredient to the bread is a starter containing yeast and
lactobacillus bacteria living on a diet of flour and water. The yeast
is what makes the bread rise, and the bacterium is what gives the
bread that amazing tangy, sour flavor. However, not all lactobacillus
strains are alike, and some create a more desirable flavor than
others, so when a baker finds a starter (i.e., a bacteria
culture/yeast mixture) that gives a really great sourdough flavor,
she&#8217;ll take care to maintain and grow the same bacterial culture by
adding more flour and water to it. She&#8217;ll then take small amounts of
the starter and inoculate the ingredients for a loaf of bread, and
<em>voilà</em>, she&#8217;s got a great loaf of sourdough! This works because the
culture in the starter not only creates the taste that she wants, but
is strong enough to overtake any other wild strains of yeast or
bacteria that might be in the bread ingredients or the air of the
bakery.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id010" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_02in02.png" alt="dbtm 02in02">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your team&#8217;s culture is much like a good loaf of sourdough: your
starter culture (your founders) inoculates your
dough (your newcomers) with the culture, and as the yeast and bacteria
(your team members) grow, out pops a great loaf of bread (your
team). If your starter culture is strong, it&#8217;s more than capable of
overcoming any undesirable "wild strains" of culture that a newcomer
might bring with him.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_8" title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup> If your starter culture
is weak, your team is vulnerable to unknown culture strains that
newcomers might bring along. Unknown cultures bring with them
unpredictable results, so it&#8217;s better to begin with a known starter
culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But a team&#8217;s culture isn&#8217;t just the way in which team members tackle
their work, write code, or treat one another: it&#8217;s a set of shared
experiences, values, and goals that is unique to every engineering
team we&#8217;ve ever been on or observed. The founding members of a team or
company define the biggest part of a team&#8217;s culture, but it will
continue to change and develop over the life of the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The elements that make up a
team culture vary
wildly. Some are directly relevant to the <em>process</em> of doing work:
in the case of writing software, you might set up code reviews and test-driven development, and place a high value on having good design
docs before starting to crank out reams of code. Some elements might
be more social, like going out to a particular restaurant for lunch
every Thursday, or going out for drinks at a favorite bar on
Fridays. Some of them might seem <span class="keep-together">completely</span> silly or outlandish to an
outsider: the Google Pittsburgh engineering office used to be located
next to a freight train track, and every time a train would come by
(mind you, a very loud train), everyone would jump up and shoot Nerf
darts at one another.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_9" title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup> All of these things make up a team&#8217;s culture and affect the team&#8217;s productivity
and ability to attract and retain good team members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take a look at any wildly successful software company today—Google,
Apple, Microsoft, Oracle—and you&#8217;ll find that each company has a very
different culture: one that has its roots in the culture that was set
by the founders and earliest employees. As these companies have grown
and matured, their cultures have evolved and changed, but they&#8217;ve
still retained a unique identity that trickles down to just about
every aspect of how they develop products, treat their employees, and
compete with other companies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="why_should_you_care">Why Should You Care?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, you should care because if you don&#8217;t put effort into
building and maintaining your culture, your team will eventually be
overtaken by strong personalities that cultivate <em>their</em> culture in
your team. This culture may turn out to be a productive, healthy
culture that cranks out piles of great code, but more often than not,
it won&#8217;t turn out as such, and you&#8217;ll suddenly find a lot of your
energy that used to go into designing and creating your product is
suddenly expended in arguments and infighting. Beyond that, it&#8217;s
important to have a culture that your team values and is willing to
defend. If your team doesn&#8217;t value your culture, not only is it
difficult to build a strong team identity and collective pride in your
work, but also it&#8217;s very easy for a newcomer to change your culture
into something that sucks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first mistake most team <em>members</em> make is to assume the team
<em>leader</em> curates the culture of a team. Nothing could be further
from the truth: while the founders and leads usually tend to the
health of your culture, every member of your team participates in the
culture and bears some responsibility for defining, maintaining, and
defending the culture. When someone joins your team, she doesn&#8217;t pick
up the culture from the team leader alone, but from every team member
she works with. For example, when you carefully review your new team
member&#8217;s work and explain to her why your team does something in a
certain way, she&#8217;ll quickly figure out what the team values in their
product. She&#8217;ll also learn about your culture from observing how the
rest of your team works, interacts, and deals with conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A "strong culture" is one that is open to change that improves it, yet
is resistant to radical change that harms it. The team cultures that are most successful are
those that focus the majority of the team&#8217;s effort on shipping great
software. If your team&#8217;s primary focus is anything other than that
(e.g., partying, attending meetings, practicing one-upmanship) your
team may bond tightly, but you won&#8217;t get very much software
written. If you&#8217;re happiest when writing code and shipping product,
it&#8217;s definitely in your best interest to find a team that values that,
and to work to maintain that environment. It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t
create something great without a strong and productive culture, but
it&#8217;s going to cost you a lot more time and energy to do so without
one. A strong culture gives you focus, efficiency, and strength, and
these things make for a happier team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interesting thing about team culture is that, if you build a
strongly defined one, it will become self-selecting. In the open source world, projects that
are built on HRT and focused on writing clean, elegant, maintainable
code will attract engineers who are interested in—surprise,
surprise—working with people they respect and trust, and writing
clean, elegant, maintainable code. If, however, your team is built on
a culture of aggression, hazing, and ad hominem attacks, you&#8217;re going
to wind up attracting more people like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve seen self-selecting cultures many times in the Apache Software
Foundation: the ASF is a collection of software development teams that
are community-based and that run on a consensus model. Many times a
new contributor will join the mailing list and, through either
ignorance or malice, will behave in a manner contrary to the team&#8217;s
culture. Community members will usually attempt to educate the
newcomer (sometimes gently, sometimes, um, well, "not so gently"), and
if the newcomer is not interested in how the ASF team does things,
they&#8217;ll usually head off in search of a more compatible project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the corporate world, teams self-select through the hiring process,
whether implicitly in the skills and strengths that are valued in
potential candidates, or explicitly by considering culture fit as part
of the hiring process. Google takes the explicit approach in its
hiring process as it looks specifically for culture fit when
interviewing candidates: if Google interviews someone who in all
respects looks like an outstanding engineer, but is incapable of
working with a team of people or
requires a very structured environment, the interviewers will raise a
red flag in their feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t pay attention to culture fit as part of the hiring
process and hire someone who isn&#8217;t a fit, you&#8217;ll wind up expending a
tremendous amount of energy either getting the new hire to fit in or
getting him to leave your team. Regardless of the result, the cost is high
enough that it&#8217;s definitely worthwhile to make sure new team members will work well with your
existing team.</p>

<div class="title">Interviewing for culture</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only way to make sure new team members will be a culture fit is to
interview for it. Many companies (like Google) have culture fit as one
of the criteria that interviewers look out for as they&#8217;re speaking to
a candidate. Some companies take it even further in their quest to
avoid a hiring mistake: they have a separate interview for culture fit
<em>before</em> doing the technical interviews because they don&#8217;t want to
even consider people who would fit technically but not
culturally. This sort of process involvement is critical for creating
and preserving a strong culture and it doesn&#8217;t happen by accident; in
fact, it is usually consciously created by the company&#8217;s founders and
early employees.</p>

<h3 id="culture_and_people">Culture and People</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creative work like writing software is different from simply knocking out widgets on an
assembly line. Some types of work can be done with a few days of
training and some basic tools, and if your worker quits and leaves (or
doesn&#8217;t work out), you just drop another worker in and on you go. In
the assembly line environment, employees are accomplishing simple
tasks, often by rote, with little creative-thinking or problem-solving
skills required. In the software world, a great deal of creative
thinking is required of engineers working on a
product,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup> and if you want a great product, you need great
engineers. If you want great engineers to do great work (and to stick
around), you need to create a culture for them that allows them to
safely share ideas and have a voice in the decision-making process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to get excellent engineers to work on your team, you need
to start by hiring, well, some great engineers! That may sound weird,
but the fact of the matter is that most great engineers want to be on
teams with <em>other</em> great engineers. Many great engineers we know
gravitate toward teams where they can learn from giants of the
industry.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_11" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_11" title="View footnote.">11</a>]</sup> So
how do you attract these engineers in the first place?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For starters, they&#8217;re going to want to be able to not only contribute
to the development of
your product, but also participate in the product&#8217;s decision-making
process, and that usually means some level of consensus-driven
management. In the case of top-down management, the alpha engineer is
the team lead and lesser engineers are hired as team members. This is
because subservient team members cost less and are easier to push
around. And you&#8217;re going to have a hard time finding great engineers
to be on this team because, after all, what really great engineer
wants to <em>ride</em> the bus when she can <em>drive</em> the bus at another
company? But in the case of consensus-driven management, the entire
team participates in the decision-making process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people hear "consensus-based team" and immediately think of a
bunch of hippies singing "Kumbaya" around a campfire and never making
a decision or getting anything done, but that stereotype is
symptomatic of a dysfunctional team much more than a consensus-based
team. What we mean by "consensus" is that everyone has a strong sense
of ownership and responsibility for the product&#8217;s success and that the
leaders really listen to the team (with an emphasis on the "respect"
component of HRT). This may mean there are times when extended
discussion and reflection is what the product needs to succeed, and
there are other times when the team
agrees they need to move quickly. In the latter case, team members may
decide to entrust a great deal of the nitty-gritty day-to-day
decision making to one or more team
leads.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_12" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_12" title="View footnote.">12</a>]</sup> In order for this to happen,
the team as a whole needs to agree on the general mission of the team,
and believe it or not, the key to that is the development of a team
mission statement (more on that later in this chapter).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as important as your team&#8217;s decision-making process is the manner in which team members
treat one another, because this is more self-selecting than anything
else. If your team has a culture of chest thumping and yelling and
screaming at one another, the only people you&#8217;ll attract (and retain)
are aggressive types who feel right at home in this
environment composed of strong <span class="keep-together">individual</span> egos (in fact, most of the
women we know find this kind of environment especially
off-putting). If you create a culture of HRT where team members treat
one another kindly and take the effort to give constructive criticism, you&#8217;ll not only attract a much
larger set of people, but you&#8217;ll also spend a great deal more of your
energy writing software. Having a strong team ego<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_13" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_13" title="View footnote.">13</a>]</sup> is good; a team totally eclipsed by
<em>individual</em> egos is a recipe for disaster. We&#8217;ll discuss how to
prevent this sort of situation in <a href="#dealing_with_poisonous_people">Dealing with Poisonous People</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Constructive criticism is essential
to the growth and development of any person or team, but many people
will go to great lengths to avoid soliciting criticism.  In some cases
this is due to insecurity, but in most cases that we&#8217;ve seen it is
because a person thinks that they are required to take action on any
criticism received, even if they disagree with it.  The best part
about getting good constructive criticism is that you can pick and
choose which pieces you want to act on. Let&#8217;s say, for example, that
you&#8217;re getting ready for an important job interview and put on your
favorite suit. You approach a trusted friend and ask how you look. If
they say, "You&#8217;ve got spinach in your teeth, and I really hate your
suit" you can take a quick floss break, but you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to
change clothes as well. Criticism is a gift that you can either accept
or reject.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in improving your work or fixing your own
personal bugs, these very friends and colleagues are the ones that can
make you aware of things you do that might be hindering your
effectiveness. Unless you have a truly remarkable level of
self-awareness or introspection, without criticism, you&#8217;ll just go on
making the same mistakes no one wants to tell you about. For example,
in the process of going to press with this book, we&#8217;ve had no fewer
than a dozen people look at it and give us constructive criticism on our writing, and most of it was
incredibly detailed and completely invaluable. Regardless of whether
you think the book is good or bad, it would have been <em>considerably
worse</em> if we had ignored this valuable feedback or been afraid to ask
for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>It requires a certain amount of self-confidence
to take any kind of criticism, and we think constructive criticism is
the easiest kind to receive. On the downside, it&#8217;s a lot harder to
give someone constructive criticism than to simply lambast her or
ridicule something she did. Of course, we realize it&#8217;s incredibly
difficult to solicit and then receive constructive criticism from most
people—they assume that when you ask them to criticize your work,
you&#8217;re only looking for compliments and assurance. If you can find
friends or colleagues who will constructively criticize your work when
you ask them, hang on to these people because they&#8217;re worth their
weight in unobtainium.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aggressive people can (usually) be productive
in a quieter environment, but quieter, more introverted people rarely
excel (or enjoy working) in an aggressive environment—it&#8217;s not only
harder to hear their voices over the noise, but it also tends to
discourage them from being active
participants.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_14" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_14" title="View footnote.">14</a>]</sup> If you&#8217;re looking for a
culture that allows the broadest range of people to work most
efficiently, you should build that culture on humility, respect, and
trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Calm, easygoing cultures built on respect are more vulnerable to
disruption by aggressive people than aggressive cultures are
vulnerable to disruption from more easygoing people. Easygoing
cultures need to be aware of this and not let the aggressive newcomer
take over, typically by refusing to engage this person in an
aggressive tone. In some cases, one or more of the more senior team
members may have to meet the aggressive newcomer head-on to prevent
her from harming an easygoing team culture. Again, we&#8217;ll talk a lot more about how to deal
with these sorts of "poisonous people" in

<h3 id="communication_patterns_of_successful_cul">Communication Patterns of Successful Cultures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication can often be a challenge when you&#8217;re working with a team,
Communication can often be a challenge when working with a team,
particularly for engineers, who would rather spend an afternoon with a
(predictable, logical) compiler than spend three minutes with a
(unpredictable, emotional) human being. In many cases, engineers see
communication work as an obstacle to be overcome on the road to
writing more code, but if your team isn&#8217;t in agreement or is uninformed, there&#8217;s no way to
know if you&#8217;re writing the right code in the first place.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you examine any successful, efficient culture, you&#8217;ll find high
value placed on numerous channels of communication, such as mailing
lists, design docs, chat rooms, mission statements, code comments,
production how-tos, and more. It takes considerable effort to make
sure everyone on a team agrees on the team&#8217;s direction and understands
exactly what the team needs to do. All this effort, however, is an
investment that pays off in increased productivity and team happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good general rule around communication is to include as few people
as necessary in <em>synchronous</em> communication (like meetings and phone
calls), and to go for a broader audience in <em>asynchronous</em>
communication (like email, issue trackers, and document
comments). Synchronous communications have a high cost: they require
that participants interrupt their workday and receive information on
your schedule. Asynchronous communications, however, can be dealt with
at a time and place most convenient for the recipient.  Every time you
interrupt someone&#8217;s work it will take some amount of time for them to
get back up to speed—always be conscious of when you&#8217;re doing this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But most importantly, you should make certain that all
information is available to as many people as possible in your
project&#8217;s documentation. Let&#8217;s cover the primary communication mechanisms that
people use in the process of writing software with a
team. Some of these may seem
obvious, but there are many nuances that make them worth
reviewing. One thing is certain: if you don&#8217;t expend any effort on
good communication, you&#8217;ll
waste considerable effort doing work that&#8217;s either unnecessary or
already being done by other members of your team.</p>

<p>For an effective, efficient team, writing a mission statement is a way
to concisely define the direction and limit the scope of your
product. Writing a good mission statement takes some time and effort,
but it can potentially save you <em>years</em> of work by clarifying what
your team should and shouldn&#8217;t<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_15" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_15" title="View footnote.">15</a>]</sup> be working on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Google decided to move development of the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) to an open source project, we acted
as the team mentors. We reviewed the many differences between open and
closed source development, paying specific attention to the
difficulties of designing, discussing, and writing software in an
environment where anyone can poke their nose in to offer an opinion,
contribute a patch, or criticize the most minute aspect of your
product.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_16" title="View footnote.">16</a>]</sup> After going over these challenges, we told
the team they needed to come up with a mission statement as a way to
describe to the public at large what their product goals (and nongoals!) were.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the team members balked at this for many of the reasons
outlined earlier, but others seemed curious, and the team lead seemed
to think it was a great idea. However, when we sat down to start
writing the mission statement, a lot of debate about the content,
substance, and style of the mission statement ensued. After a great
deal of discussion (and a few more meetings), the team came up not
only with a great, concise mission statement, but also an entire
document called "Making GWT Better"<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_17" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_17" title="View footnote.">17</a>]</sup> explaining the
statement phrase by phrase. They even included a section that
described what the project&#8217;s
<em>nongoals</em> were. Here&#8217;s the mission statement:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GWT&#8217;s mission is to radically improve the web experience for users
by enabling developers to use existing Java tools to build
no-compromise AJAX for any modern browser.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of substance packed into that sentence, and we think
it&#8217;s an excellent example of a mission statement: it includes both a
direction (improve the web experience…by enabling developers) and a
scope limiter (Java tools). Several years later we were having dinner
with the team lead, and Fitz told him how thankful we were that he had
supported us so strongly in our effort to get the team to write a
mission statement. He
responded that he had actually thought the entire exercise was a waste
of time when we first proposed it, but that once he started debating
it with the team, he discovered something he&#8217;d never known: his lead
engineers did not agree on the direction of the product!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, writing a mission statement forced them to confront
their differences and come to an agreement on their product&#8217;s
direction, a problem that could have slowed down (or stopped)
development of the product as time went on. They posted their mission
statement on the Web, and not only did the entire team have a laser
focus on what they wanted to do with their product, but it saved them
months of time arguing with potential contributors about the product&#8217;s
direction—they just pointed newcomers to "Making GWT Better" and most questions were
answered.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As your project progresses, the mission statement keeps things on
track. It shouldn&#8217;t become an insurmountable impediment to change,
however. If radical changes happen to the environment or business plan
(say, at a startup company), software team members need to be honest
with themselves and reevaluate whether the mission still makes
sense. Changing a constitution is a deliberately difficult process, as
it prevents people from doing so whimsically. But in dramatic times
it&#8217;s at least <em>possible</em> to change it and it should be
considered. If a company or product pivots suddenly, the mission
statement needs to keep up.</p>

<h4 id="efficient_meetings">Efficient Meetings</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people would classify meetings as a necessary evil. While they
can be highly effective when used skillfully, they&#8217;re frequently
abused, usually disorganized, and almost always too long. We like our
meetings like we like our sewage treatment plants: few, far between,
and downwind. So we&#8217;ll keep this section brief and just cover team
meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most dreaded meeting of
all: the standing meeting. This meeting
usually takes place every week, and should absolutely be kept to basic
announcements and introductions—going around the room for a status
update from every attendee (whether they have something important to
add or not) is a recipe for wasted time, rolling eyes, and a burning
desire to punch yourself in the throat just to make it end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anything worth deeper discussion should take place after the meeting,
with only the relevant people sticking around for it. This is also a
great way to avoid derailing a meeting when someone starts to do a
deep dive into a particular meeting topic: the person running the
meeting should just add the topic to a list of "sidebars" and once the
meeting is over, review them one at a time. If your team makes this a
habit, it&#8217;s easy to call "sidebar" on something that&#8217;s getting
off-track without putting anyone off. The key to making this meeting
work is that people should be happy to leave the meeting once the main
part of it is done, and if there&#8217;s nothing that needs to be covered,
or information that can be disseminated by email, don&#8217;t hesitate to
cancel the meeting. We&#8217;ve seen some cultures where meeting attendance
is equated with status, so nobody wanted to be left out. Not to put
too fine a point on it, but that is patently insane.</p>

these are acceptable if they are kept short and on point. These
meetings usually start their lives short—15 minutes—with everyone
actually standing up and giving a brief update on what they&#8217;re working
on, but without constant vigilance they tend to quickly turn into
30-minute-long sit-down meetings where people ramble on and on like
they&#8217;re in a group therapy session. If your team is going to have
these meetings, <em>someone</em> needs to run them with authority and keep
their growth in check.</p>

decisions. If you don&#8217;t believe us, get five of your friends together,
go downtown, and try to decide among the six of you how to do a
walking tour that hits half a dozen tourist sites. The odds are good

<p>If you&#8217;re going to have a meeting, create an agenda and distribute it
to all attendees at least a day before the meeting so that they&#8217;ll
know what to expect. Invite as few people as possible (remember the
cost of synchronous communication). We know team members, managers,
and even directors and VPs who will flat out ignore invitations to a
meeting that has no agenda.</p>

<p>Only invite people to the meeting who actually need to be there for
the meeting to accomplish its goal. Some people have taken to banning
laptops in meetings
after they&#8217;ve noticed attendees reading email instead of paying
attention, but this is attacking the symptom and not the cause—people
start reading email in a meeting because they probably <em>don&#8217;t need to
be in the meeting in the first place</em>.</p>

<p>Whoever&#8217;s running the meeting should actually run the meeting and not
hesitate to (gently) cut off someone who veers off-topic or, even
worse, tries to monopolize the conversation. Doing this well can be
tricky, but is worthwhile. And most importantly, don&#8217;t be afraid to

<h4 id="working_in_a_geographically_challenged_t">Working in a "Geographically Challenged" Team</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re part of a distributed team or
working remotely from them, you not only need to find different ways
to communicate, but also need to put more work into communication,
period. If you&#8217;re on a team that has remote workers, this means
documenting and sharing decisions in writing, usually over
email. Online chats, instant messages, and hallway
conversations might be where a lot of discussion takes place, but
there needs to be some way to broadcast relevant discussions like
these to everyone to make sure they&#8217;re informed and participating (and
as a bonus, archived email lists provide
documentation). Video chat is also incredibly
useful as a quick conversation enabler, and besides, these days most
laptops have built in webcams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Subversion project we had a motto: "If the discussion didn&#8217;t
happen on the email list, then it never really happened." People spent
lots of time bandying around ideas in chat rooms, but in order to
make the resolutions "real" we had to be mindful of everyone else who
didn&#8217;t witness them. By forcing conversations to repost to email
lists, we gave the entire distributed team a chance to see how
decisions were arrived at (and to speak up if they wanted to). This is
particularly critical if you&#8217;re trying to encourage a consensus-based
team culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Talking to someone from a remote location should be as frictionless as
walking over to their desk. If you&#8217;re working remotely,
overcommunicate with your team using every available medium (e.g.,
online chat, instant
messages, email, video chat, phone calls, etc.) to make sure everyone
knows not only that you exist, but also what you&#8217;re working on. And
most important of all, <em>do not underestimate the bandwidth of a
face-to-face conversation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fitz once had an engineer who was working with a team in Colorado, and
she was having trouble getting momentum on the project that she was
sharing with them. She pulled Fitz aside to tell him this and he told
her that she should hop on a flight to Colorado and spend a week with
the team to kickstart their project. Two weeks later, she emailed Fitz
from Colorado, after spending only a day there, with great news—not only
had she gained great momentum on the project, but she was getting
along great with the team after joining them for lunch and drinks
after work.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ben once had a team member, Corey, who started a new project with a
team in another office. Corey was having a bit of a tough time getting
traction with the new team and lamented this to Ben in their weekly
one-on-one. Ben told Corey that he should fly out to the team&#8217;s office
and sit with them for a week to kick off the project. Corey was
hesitant because of the cost of a flight and hotel, but
he wasn&#8217;t accounting for the <em>benefit</em> of the trip. Corey took a
two-day trip to work with the team and he immediately realized how
valuable it was to be there with the team. Not only did he gain the
benefit of the additional bandwidth of in-person conversation, but, by
having lunch together, and going out together after work one
day, Corey and the team all got to know each other as <em>people</em>. As a result,
future interactions with the team went much more smoothly, despite the
fact that Corey was a thousand miles
away.</p>

<p>One thing to note about all of these people is that, despite all the
advances in social media and videoconferencing technology, nothing
even comes close to the bandwidth and the intimacy of being face to

or have an important meeting with someone in your company and you have
the budget to be there in person, it&#8217;s almost always worth the hassle

<h4 id="design_docs">Design Docs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re an engineer, it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to resist the urge to
take a running leap into writing code for a new project, but this is
rarely fruitful (unless you&#8217;re throwing together a quick and dirty
prototype). Just the same, many engineers rush right into coding
before designing the software they intend to write, and this usually
ends very badly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A design doc is typically owned by one person, authored by two or
three, and reviewed by a larger set. It serves not only as a
high-level blueprint of your future project, but also as a low-cost
way to communicate to your larger team what you want to do and how you
intend to do it. Since you haven&#8217;t spent weeks (or months) writing
code, it&#8217;s a lot easier to accept criticism at this point and you&#8217;ll
wind up with a better product and a better implementation. In
addition, once you&#8217;ve nailed down the design doc, it will serve as
your guide for both scheduling and dividing the work on your
project. Once you start coding, however, you should treat your design
doc as a living document and not one carved in stone: you and your
team <em>should</em> update the document as your project grows and changes,
not once you&#8217;ve shipped, although this is easier said than done. Most
teams have no docs at all, while the rest have a short period of
awesome docs, followed by a long period of out-of-date docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having said that, make sure you don&#8217;t take the "design doc religion"
to the opposite extreme. We&#8217;ve seen control freaks write a four-page
design essay for a program that&#8217;s only 100 lines of code. If the
project can be rewritten from scratch several times in the same amount
of time it takes to write a design doc, a design doc is clearly a
waste of time. Use experience and judgment when making these time
calculations and trade-offs.</p>

<h4 id="mailing_lists">Mailing Lists</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t know of anyone who works with a team these days that doesn&#8217;t
use at least one mailing list, but there are a few things you can do
with your mailing lists
to make them more useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many big successful projects have multiple mailing lists, separating
development discussions, code reviews, user discussions,
announcements, pager emails, and miscellaneous
administrivia. Sometimes smaller projects attempt to emulate this as
they&#8217;re just getting started and create half a dozen mailing lists
when they&#8217;ve only got three engineers and two users. This is the
mailing list equivalent of providing six conference rooms for five
people to carry on a discussion—you wind up with little coherence, a
lot of echoes, and mostly empty rooms. It&#8217;s really best to start with
one list, and to add lists only when the amount of traffic on one list
gets unmanageable (which is typically indicated by list members
begging for mercy). An exception to that rule is to have automated
emails and "bot" notifications go to their own list or at the very
least use identifiers that make them easy to filter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take some time to establish proper etiquette around email
discussions—keep discussions civil, and prevent filibustering by a
"noisy minority."<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_20" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_20" title="View footnote.">20</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A mailing list isn&#8217;t going to be your first choice for a discussion in
a team that shares an office, but it&#8217;s a good idea to send a copy of
meeting agendas, meeting notes, decisions
made, design docs, and any other relevant textual information to your
team&#8217;s mailing list so that you have a convenient central record. Set
up these lists to archive all posts in a <em>searchable</em> index, either
publicly available in the case of open source projects or on your
company&#8217;s intranet if you&#8217;re working on a closed source project. Now
you have a system of record for the history of your project, and it&#8217;s
easy to refer back to it when a newcomer asks about the reasoning
behind one or more decisions that you made in the past. If you don&#8217;t
have these discussions archived somewhere, you&#8217;ll find yourself
repeating them again and again and again and again.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="online_chat">Online Chat</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Online chat is an incredibly convenient way for teams to communicate,
especially since it provides a way to send a quick request to a
teammate without interrupting her work (providing, of course, she has
her chat program configured to not interrupt her work!). It&#8217;s a good
tool for teams to use if they&#8217;re moving quickly on a new project,
doing some light work in the evening or on the weekend, or if one team
member is out of the office for a day or two. One-on-one chat is
useful and certainly has its place in team communication, but we
strongly recommend that teams use some sort of group chat
mechanism.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_21" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_21" title="View footnote.">21</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Years before instant messaging became wildly
popular, teams would hang out in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
channel and most of their discussions would be in a group chat. This
could be noisy at times, and it was easy enough for team members to
break off to have a private chat if they were discussing something
that was not of interest to the larger team, but in most cases
discussions happened "in front of" the rest of the team. This allowed
other people to join in on the conversation, lurk in the background
and follow the discussion, or even catch up on discussions they missed
earlier. This is convenient not only because of the ease with which ad
hoc group discussions can start, but also because it helps to build
community even in teams that are geographically dispersed. It&#8217;s often
surprising how much a newer team member can learn just by watching (or
later reading) various discussions he&#8217;s not necessarily participating
in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the advent of instant messaging, many of these conversations that
would previously take place in the group chat room moved to private
chat, which was the default for instant messenger. It&#8217;s very tempting
to indulge your insecurity and take what might be perceived as a
stupid question to a one-on-one discussion rather than risk
embarrassment in front of the rest of the team. Unfortunately, this
increases the burden on the team because there&#8217;s no shared lore
created and different team members may ask other team members the same
question over and over again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, group chat has seen a renaissance in 2014/2015 with the
rise of Slack, a free (but not free software or open source) group
messaging client that feels a lot like a modern-day IRC.  Slack
integrates with dozens of other products and has become the messaging
tool of choice in smaller companies, startups, and even loosely
connected groups of acquaintances on the Internet.  While it still
provides a means to send private messages, team owners get a weekly
report telling them the percentage of private messages versus group
messages.  This makes it easy to give your team a gentle "push" to
have more discussions in the group channels rather than one-on-one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the application you use for chat, we <em>strongly</em>
recommend that your team have a convenient and accessible mechanism
for group chat. It&#8217;s well worth the effort in order to have this
additional communication bandwidth in your team.</p>

<p>When many people first hear about IRC
these days, they scoff at its primitive text-based environment because
even the most modern of IRC clients tend to be less whizzy than
outdated versions of iChat or Google Talk. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the
outdated look and feel of IRC—its killer features are that it was
designed for multiperson chat and it&#8217;s asynchronous; most clients
keep an unlimited scroll-back record so that you can read back to see
conversations among others that you missed. Slack is basically the
modern-day version of IRC, and despite its whizzy integration of
graphics, avatars, and emoji, at its heart it&#8217;s still a text-based
messaging system like IRC. It may be tempting to try out fancy
videoconferencing packages, shared whiteboard systems, and more, but
these systems often tend to be ineffective and can eliminate the
asynchronous advantage of text-based group chat. If you&#8217;re going to
use something other than Slack or IRC, find something that is actually
designed for group chat and isn&#8217;t just an instant messaging system
with group chat bolted on.</p>

<p>Sometimes people are more comfortable chatting online: we remember the first time we went to a hackathon
where a number of open source contributors were going to meet (many
for the first time) face to face and work on their projects
together. We walked into an almost silent room to find a dozen
tables—with six to eight people per table—furiously typing away at
their laptops. We figured that, well, we were late, and everyone was
already busy writing code, so we sat down, opened our laptops, fired
up our editors, and signed on to the project&#8217;s IRC channel to see if
folks who couldn&#8217;t make it to the hackathon were "virtually" there. We found a number of conversations taking place in the IRC
channel. We said hello and mentioned that we&#8217;d just arrived at the
hackathon room, and imagine our surprise when several people said
hello in the IRC channel when they turned out to be sitting less than
10 feet away from us! Some of this was purely inertia as we were all
used to chatting online, but in many cases it was
just the most comfortable way for some people to communicate with the
rest of the group. Fresh off a four-hour flight and desperate for some
communication bandwidth, we got up and went from table to table to
talk with people face to face.</p>

<p>There are no hard and fast rules for when to use chat versus email. Chat
is more useful for fast-moving real-time discussions where a decision

email might be better. Just keep in mind the costs of synchronous

<p>If you&#8217;re going to use an issue/bug tracker (and you should), it&#8217;s important that you
have some sort of process in place for processing and triaging bugs to

your bug tracker is neglected and not prioritized, people will stop
filing bugs and begin shouting complaints into the void; and when your

into the bug tracker, more than likely they will be fixing unimportant
bugs and ignoring important ones.</p>

should be recorded as updates in the bug tracker, making thoughts and
decisions "official" for all to see. Keep the tone civil and don&#8217;t
tolerate trollish behaviors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve also seen numerous occasions where a project manager is assigned
the task of checking in on all open issues in the issue tracker. This
can often not only create a great deal of churn, but also lead team members
to start lengthy conversations in the issue tracker. If conversations
get overly long or fragmented, take the discussion temporarily to the
main email list—an email client is a much better tool for complex
threads.</p>

<h4 id="code_comments">Code Comments</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code commenting style is very subjective. Verbose
comments can often provide clues regarding the intent and reasoning of
the original programmer and can be very useful, but at the cost of
ongoing maintenance: out-of-date or incorrect comments drastically
hinder understanding of a code base. Similarly, terse or nonexistent
comments can cause future maintainers or API consumers to waste time
sleuthing. Comments are often used to point out missing structure and
bad naming, and then go on to reexplain what the code already says. Comments should be focused on <em>why</em>
the code is doing what it&#8217;s doing, not <em>what</em> the code is
doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Comments are most useful at the function or method level, especially
as a means of documenting an API, and without going into exhaustive
details, comments can be summed up with the popular Greek maxim,
"μηδέν άγαν," or "nothing in excess."
Beyond that, take the time to come up with a commenting style for your team and have everyone stick to it—we think being
consistent is more important than the actual
choice.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_22" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_22" title="View footnote.">22</a>]</sup> Your style guide should also explain the reason the guide
exists and what it intends to prescribe—for example, here&#8217;s the
introduction to the Google C++ Style

<div class="paragraph">
<p>C++ is the main development language used by many of Google&#8217;s
open-source projects. As every C++ programmer knows, the language
has many powerful features, but this power brings with it complexity,
which in turn can make code more bug-prone and harder to read and
maintain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in
detail the dos and don&#8217;ts of writing C++ code. These rules exist
to keep the code base manageable while still allowing coders to use
C++ language features productively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Style, also known as readability, is what we call the conventions
that govern our C++ code. The term Style is a bit of a misnomer,
since these conventions cover far more than just source file
formatting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way in which we keep the code base manageable is by enforcing
consistency. It is very important that any programmer be able to look
at another&#8217;s code and quickly understand it. Maintaining a uniform
style and following conventions means that we can more easily use
"pattern-matching" to infer what various symbols are and what
invariants are true about them. Creating common, required idioms and
patterns makes code much easier to understand. In some cases there
might be good arguments for changing certain style rules, but we
<span class="keep-together">nonetheless</span> keep things as they are in order to preserve
consistency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another issue this guide addresses is that of <span class="keep-together">C++</span> feature
bloat. C++ is a huge language with many advanced features. In some
cases we constrain, or even ban, use of certain features. We do this
to keep code simple and to avoid the various common errors and
problems that these features can cause. This guide lists these
features and explains why their use is <span class="keep-together">restricted</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open-source projects developed by Google conform to the requirements
in this guide.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this guide is not a C++ tutorial: we assume that the
reader is familiar with the language.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the guide doesn&#8217;t make claims about enforcing the best or fastest way
to write C++, but merely the importance of having consistency

<h4 id="putting_your_name_in_source_code_files_a">Putting Your Name on Your Work</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everyone wants to get credit for work they do, from the artist who
signs her painting to the author who puts her name on the spine of her
book or the top of her blog. It&#8217;s human nature to crave recognition in
one way or another, but littering source files with your name is, in
our opinion, more trouble than it&#8217;s worth. We&#8217;ve all seen these
attributions at the top of source files, nestled snugly against the
copyright declarations:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tradition of putting your name at the top of your source code is
an old one (heck, both of us have done it in the past), and may have
been appropriate in an age where programs were written by individuals
and not teams. Today, however, many people may touch a particular
piece of code, and the issue of name attribution in a file is the
cause of much discussion, wasted time, and hurt feelings. As a result,
we advocate strongly against names as a sign of ownership in source
code files (at best, include a name to designate a first choice to
review any changes you might make to the file, but be careful that you
don&#8217;t imply <span class="keep-together">ownership</span>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine, for example, that you create a new file in your
team&#8217;s <span class="keep-together">project—</span>you
write a few hundred lines of code, smack your name and the appropriate
copyright header at the top of the file and send it off for code
review, and later, commit it to the repository. No problems, no drama,
no disagreements so far. Let&#8217;s say that your teammate Adrian comes
along and makes some changes to the file: at what point does he get to
put his name at the top of the file? Does he have to fix a bug? Five
bugs? Does he have to write a function? Two functions? How many lines
of code does he have to write? What if he writes a function, slaps his
name on the file, and then someone else comes along and rewrites "his"
function? Does this person now get to put her name on the file? Does
she get to take Adrian&#8217;s name off? Unlike other collaborative pieces
of creative work—plays, novels, films—software keeps changing even after it&#8217;s
"done." So, while listing contributor credits at the end of a movie is
a safe and static thing, attempting to add and remove names from a
source file is a never-ending exercise in
insanity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certainly you can answer all these questions and extensively document
every possible edge case, but maintaining this, tracking it, and
keeping an eye out for violations is an incredible waste of time—time
that could be spent actually writing code. It&#8217;s for this very reason
that we advocate tracking credit at the <em>project level</em>, not in the
code itself. Most projects that we&#8217;ve
seen have an &quot;Authors&quot; or &quot;Contributors&quot; file that lists everyone who
has done work. If you need more detail, your version control system
can tell you. Of course, if you <em>don&#8217;t</em> use version control, all
those moments will be lost in time, like tears in
rain.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_24" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_24" title="View footnote.">24</a>]</sup></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to have coding standards, you need to have a means of

before committing it or after committing it, you should make sure
every line of code that goes into your repository gets a second pair
of eyes on it to check for style, quality, and, of course, careless
mistakes. Keep code changes small and <span class="keep-together">reviewable—</span>changesets that are
thousands of lines long are unreviewable for anything but formatting

<p>Although these habits of culture and communication may seem to represent a certain amount of bias, as
they reflect the manner in which we prefer to work, it&#8217;s not as
subjective as you might think. We&#8217;ve found that building a strong,
productive team culture and taking some time
to pay attention to communication in the team creates a team that will
spend more time writing and shipping product and less time arguing about
what product to ship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strong teams don&#8217;t arise spontaneously; they&#8217;re carefully seeded and
cultivated by team leads and
founders who understand the high cost of trying to write software with
a dysfunctional team. Putting this work in from the outset helps to
create a self-selecting culture that builds a team that will spend
much more time designing and creating a product than defining and defending
their culture. A big side benefit of this effort—communication and process—is that it
drastically reduces the barrier to entry for newcomers to your
team. Without these elements in place, newcomers will either waste a
lot of time struggling to learn how your team works or give up and try
to make your team work like their last team did (for good or for bad).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While getting the right people on your team and the right values
instilled in your team is important, the overwhelming majority of
effort that goes into a culture turns out to be communication. Mission
statements, meetings, mailing lists, online chat, code comments,
documentation, and even decision-making processes all make up the many
different ways your team communicates, both with itself and with
others. It&#8217;s often a surprise to people that it takes so much
communication—including emotional time and effort—to build a strong
team for the sole purpose of creating a product, but it&#8217;s true. Your
product is ultimately about communications with <em>people</em>, not just
with a machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No matter what your team&#8217;s culture is, and regardless of how well your
team communicates, every effective team that we&#8217;ve ever seen has a
leader. In the next chapter, we&#8217;ll look into what makes the most
effective team leader, why her role is probably not what you think,
and why it&#8217;s important for every team member to understand the basics
of leading a team.</p>

<h3 id="deprecated_manager">Manager Is a Four-Letter Word</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The present-day concept of the pointy-haired manager is partially a
carryover, first from military hierarchy and later adopted by the
Industrial
Revolution<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_26" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_26" title="View footnote.">26</a>]</sup>—more than
100 years ago! Factories started popping up everywhere, and they
required (usually unskilled) workers to keep the assembly lines
moving. Consequently, these workers required supervisors to manage
them, and since it was easy to replace these workers with other people
who were desperate for a job, the managers had little motivation to
treat their employees well or improve conditions for them. Whether
humane or not, this method worked well for many years when the
employees had nothing more to do than perform rote tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Managers frequently treated employees in the same way that cart
drivers would treat their mules: they motivated them by alternately
leading them forward with a carrot, and, when that didn&#8217;t work,
whipping them with a stick. This "carrot and stick" method of management survived the
transition from the factory<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_27" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_27" title="View footnote.">27</a>]</sup> to the modern office, where the stereotype
of the hard-ass manager-as-mule-driver flourished in the middle part
of the 20<sup>th</sup> century when employees would work at the same job for
years and years (frequently relying on their pension as well).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This continues today in some industries—even in industries that
require creative thinking and problem solving—despite numerous studies
suggesting that the anachronistic carrot and stick is
ineffective<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_28" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_28" title="View footnote.">28</a>]</sup>
and harmful to the productivity of creative people. While the
assembly-line worker of years past could be trained in days and
replaced at will, knowledge workers can take <em>months</em> to get up to
speed on a new team. Unlike the replaceable assembly-line worker,
these people need nurturing, time, and space to think and <em>create</em>.</p>

<h4 id="leader_is_the_new_manager">"Leader" Is the New "Manager"</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people still use the title "manager" despite the fact that it&#8217;s
often an anachronism. We think the term <em>manager</em> should be
eliminated and the term <em>leader</em> should be used instead. While we&#8217;re
hardly members of the stalwart, politically correct crowd, the word
<em>manager</em> has become a four-letter word—a role whose very existence
encourages new managers to <em>manage</em> their <em>reports</em>. Managers wind
up acting like parents,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_29" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_29" title="View footnote.">29</a>]</sup> and
consequently employees react like children. To frame this in the
context of HRT: if the manager makes it obvious that she trusts her
employee, the employee feels positive pressure to live up to that
trust. It&#8217;s that simple. A leader forges the way for a team, looking
out for their safety and well-being, all while making sure their needs
are met. If there&#8217;s one thing you remember from this chapter, make it

<p>Fitz had a new engineer join his team a few years ago. Jerry&#8217;s last
manager (at a different company) was adamant that Jerry be at his desk
from 9:00 to 5:00 every day, and assumed that if Jerry wasn&#8217;t there,
Jerry wasn&#8217;t working enough (which is, of course, a ridiculous
assumption). On his first day working with Fitz, Jerry came to Fitz at
4:40 p.m. and stammered out an apology that he had to leave 15 minutes
early because he had an appointment that he had been unable to
reschedule. Fitz looked at him, smiled, and told him flat out, "Look,
as long as you get your job done, I don&#8217;t care <em>what</em> time you leave
the office." Jerry stared blankly at Fitz for a few seconds, nodded,
and went on his way. Fitz treated Jerry like an adult, Jerry always
got his work done, and Fitz never
had to worry about Jerry being at his desk, because Jerry didn&#8217;t
<em>need</em> a babysitter.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being a "leader" doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have ultimate
responsibility for absolutely everything. There are different types of
leadership, some technical and some personal. In the software
development world, there are two distinct roles (and titles) for
people leading a team: TL (tech lead) and TLM (tech lead manager).<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_30" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_30" title="View footnote.">30</a>]</sup> A TL is typically responsible for the technical direction
for all (or part) of a product, while a TLM is responsible for the
technical direction for all (or part) of a product in addition to the
careers and happiness of the people on the team. This enables those
who want to focus on leading a project to avoid the people management

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aside from the general sense of malaise that most people feel when
they hear the word <em>manager</em>, there are a number of reasons that
most people don&#8217;t want to become managers. The biggest reason you&#8217;ll
hear in the software development world is that you spend much less
time writing code, which is true whether you&#8217;re a technical leader or
a people leader. We&#8217;ll talk more about that later, but first, some
more reasons why most of us avoid becoming managers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve spent the majority of your career writing code, you
typically end a day with something you can point to—whether it&#8217;s code,
a design document, or a pile of bugs you just closed—and say, "That&#8217;s
what I did today." Based on this metric of productivity, at the end of
a busy day of "management" you&#8217;ll usually find yourself thinking, "I
didn&#8217;t do a <em>damned thing</em> today." It&#8217;s the equivalent of spending
years counting the number of apples you picked each day, and changing
to a job picking bananas, only to say to yourself at the end of each
day, "I didn&#8217;t pick any apples," handily ignoring the giant pile of
bananas sitting next to you. Quantifying management work <em>is</em> more difficult than
counting widgets you turned out, and you don&#8217;t have to take credit for
your team&#8217;s work; however, making it possible for them to be happy and
productive is a big measure of your job. Just don&#8217;t fall into the trap
of counting apples when you&#8217;re picking bananas.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another big reason for not becoming a manager is often unspoken but
rooted in the famous "Peter Principle," which
states that, "In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level
of incompetence." Most people have had a manager who was incapable of
doing her job or was just really bad at managing
people,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_31" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_31" title="View footnote.">31</a>]</sup> and
we know some people who have <em>only</em> worked for bad managers. If
you&#8217;ve only been exposed to crappy managers for your entire career,
why would you ever want to <em>be</em> a manager? Why would you want to be
promoted to a role that you weren&#8217;t able to do?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are great reasons to consider becoming a manager: first, it&#8217;s a
way to scale yourself. Even if you&#8217;re great at writing code, there&#8217;s
still an upper limit to the amount of code you can write. Imagine how
much code a team of great engineers could write under your leadership!
Second, you might just be really good at it—many people who find
themselves sucked into the leadership vacuum of a project discover
that they&#8217;re exceptionally skilled at providing the kind of guidance,
help, and air cover a team needs.</p>

<h3 id="the_servant_leader">The Servant Leader</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There seems to be a sort of disease that strikes new managers where
they forget about all the awful things <em>their</em> managers did to them
and suddenly start doing these same things to "manage" the people that
report to them. The symptoms of this disease include, but are by no
means limited to, micromanaging, ignoring low performers, and hiring
pushovers. Without prompt treatment, this disease can kill an entire
team. The best advice we got when we first became managers at Google
was from Steve Vinter, an engineering
director. He said, "Above all, resist the urge to manage."  One of the
greatest urges of the newly minted manager is to actively "manage" her
employees because that&#8217;s what a manager does, right? This typically
has disastrous consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cure for the "management" disease is a liberal application of what
we call "servant leadership," which is a nice way of saying the most important thing a
leader can do is to serve her team, much like a butler or majordomo
tends to the health and well-being of a household. As a servant
leader, you should strive to create an atmosphere of humility,
respect, and trust (HRT). This may mean removing bureaucratic
obstacles that a team member can&#8217;t remove by herself, helping a team
achieve consensus, or even buying dinner for the team when they&#8217;re
working late at the office. The servant leader fills in the cracks to
smooth the way for her team and advises them when necessary, but
still isn&#8217;t afraid of getting her hands dirty. The only managing that
a servant leader does is to manage both the technical <em>and</em> social
health of the team; as tempting as it may be to focus purely on the
technical health of the team, the social health of the team is just as
important (but often infinitely harder to manage!).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a manager and you&#8217;re feeling insecure in your role (for
whatever reason), one way to make sure no one questions your authority
or threatens your job is to hire people you can push around. You can
achieve this by hiring people who aren&#8217;t as smart or ambitious as you
are, or just people who are more insecure than you. While this will
cement your position as the team leader and decision maker, it will
mean a lot more work for you. Your team won&#8217;t be able to make a move
without you leading them like dogs on a leash. If you build a team of
pushovers, you probably can&#8217;t take a vacation; the moment you leave
the room, productivity comes to a screeching halt. But surely this is
a small price to pay for feeling secure in your job, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, you should strive to hire people who are smarter than you and
can replace you. This can be difficult because these very same people
will challenge you on a regular basis (in addition to letting you know
in no uncertain terms when you screw up). These very same people will
also consistently impress you and make great things happen. They&#8217;ll be
able to direct themselves to a much greater extent, and some will be
eager to lead the team as well. You shouldn&#8217;t see this as an attempt
to usurp your power, but rather as an opportunity for you to lead an
additional team, investigate new opportunities, or even take a
vacation without worrying about checking in on the team every day to
make sure they&#8217;re getting their work done.</p>

<h4 id="antipattern_ignore_low_performers">Antipattern: Ignore Low Performers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early in Fitz&#8217;s career as a team leader at Google, the time came for
him to hand out bonus letters to his team, and he grinned as he told
his manager, "I <em>love</em> being a manager!" Without missing a beat,
Fitz&#8217;s manager, a long-time industry veteran, replied, "Sometimes you
get to be the tooth fairy, other times you have to be the
dentist."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s never any fun to pull teeth. We&#8217;ve seen team leaders do all the
right things to build incredibly strong teams, only to have these
teams fail to excel (and eventually fall apart) because of just one or
two low performers. We understand that the human
aspect is the hardest part of writing software, but the hardest part
of dealing with humans is handling someone who isn&#8217;t meeting
expectations. Sometimes people miss expectations because they&#8217;re not
working long enough or hard enough, but the most difficult cases are
when someone just isn&#8217;t capable of doing his job no matter how long or
hard he works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The team at Google that is responsible for keeping all of their
services running has a motto: "Hope is not a strategy." And nowhere is hope more overused as a strategy
than in dealing with a low performer. Most team leaders grit their
teeth, avert their eyes, and just hope that the low performer either
magically gets better or just goes away. Yet it is extremely rare that
this person does either.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the leader is hoping and the low performer isn&#8217;t getting better
(or leaving), high performers on the team waste valuable time pulling
the low performer along and team morale leaks away into the ether. You
can be sure that the team knows they&#8217;re there even if you&#8217;re ignoring
them—the rest of the team is acutely aware of who the low performers are, because they have to carry
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ignoring
low performers is also a way to keep new high performers from joining
your team, and a way to encourage existing high performers to
leave. You eventually wind up with a whole team of low performers
because they&#8217;re the only ones who <em>can&#8217;t</em> leave of their own
volition. Lastly, you aren&#8217;t even doing <em>the low performer</em> any
favors by keeping him on the team; often, someone who wouldn&#8217;t do well
on your team would actually have plenty of impact somewhere else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The benefit of dealing with a low performer as quickly as possible is
that you can put yourself in the position of helping him up <em>or</em>
out. If you deal with a low performer right away, you&#8217;ll oftentimes
find that he merely needs some encouragement or direction to slip into
a higher state of productivity. If you wait too long to deal with a
low performer, his relationship with the team is
going to be so sour and you&#8217;re going to be so frustrated that you&#8217;re
not going to be able to help him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does one coach a low performer effectively? It turns out
that the two of us have (unfortunately) had quite a lot of experience
in this area, gained through painful trial and error. The best
analogy is to imagine you&#8217;re helping a limping person learn to walk
again, then jog, then run alongside the rest of the team. It almost
always requires temporary micromanagement—but still a whole lot of
HRT, particularly respect. Set up a specific time frame (say, two or
three months), and some very specific goals you expect him to achieve
in that period. Make the goals small and incremental, so there&#8217;s an
opportunity for lots of small successes. Meet with the team member
every week to check on progress, and be sure you set really explicit
expectations around each upcoming milestone, so it&#8217;s easy to measure
success or failure. If the low
performer can&#8217;t keep up, it will become quite obvious to <em>both</em> of
you early in the process. At this point, the person will often
acknowledge that things aren&#8217;t going well and decide to quit; in other
cases, determination will kick in and he&#8217;ll "up his game" to meet
expectations. Either way, by working directly with the low performer
you&#8217;re catalyzing important and necessary changes.</p>

<h4 id="antipattern_ignore_human_issues">Antipattern: Ignore Human Issues</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ve said before, a team leader has two major areas of focus for
his team: the social and the technical. It&#8217;s rather common for leaders
to be stronger in the technical side, and since most leaders are
promoted from a technical job (where the primary goal of their job was
to solve technical problems), they tend to ignore human issues. It&#8217;s
tempting to focus all your energy on the technical side of your team
because, as an individual contributor, you spend the vast majority of your time
solving technical problems. When you were a student, your
classes were all about learning the technical ins and outs of your
work. Now that you&#8217;re a leader, however, you ignore the human element
of your team at your own peril.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an example of a leader ignoring the human element in his team. Years
ago, a close friend of Fitz&#8217;s—we&#8217;ll call him
Jake—had his first child. Jake and Fitz had worked together for years, both remotely and
in the same office, so in the weeks following the arrival of the new
baby, Jake worked from home. This worked out great for Jake and his
wife, and Fitz was totally fine with it as he was already used to
working remotely with Jake. They were their usual productive selves
until their manager, Pablo (who worked in a different office), found
out that Jake was working from home for most of the week. Pablo was
upset that Jake wasn&#8217;t going into the office to work with Fitz,
despite the fact that Jake was just as productive as always and that
Fitz was fine with the situation. Jake attempted to explain to Pablo
that he was just as productive as he would be if he came into the
office, and that it was much easier on both him and his wife for him
to mostly work from home for a few weeks. Pablo&#8217;s response: "Dude,
people have kids <em>all the time</em>. You need to go into the office."
Needless to say, Jake (normally a mild-mannered engineer) was enraged
and lost a lot of respect for Pablo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are numerous ways that Pablo could have handled this
differently: he could have showed some understanding that Jake wanted
to be home more for his wife and, if his productivity and team weren&#8217;t
being affected, just let
him continue to do so for a while. He could have negotiated that Jake
go into the office for one or two days a week until things settled
down. Regardless of the end result, a little bit of empathy would have
gone a long way toward keeping Jake happy in this situation.</p>

<h4 id="antipattern_be_everyones_friend">Antipattern: Be Everyone&#8217;s Friend</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first foray that most people have into leadership is when they
become the lead of a team of which they were formerly members. Many
leads don&#8217;t want to lose the friendships they&#8217;ve
cultivated with their teams, so they will sometimes work extra hard to
maintain friendships with their team members after becoming a team
lead. This can be a recipe for disaster and for a lot of broken
friendships. Don&#8217;t confuse friendship with leading with a soft touch:
when you hold power over someone&#8217;s career, he may feel pressure to
artificially reciprocate gestures of friendship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that you can lead a team and build consensus without being a
peer of your team (or a monumental hard-ass). Likewise, you can be a
tough leader without tossing your existing friendships to the
wind. We&#8217;ve found that having lunch with your team can be an effective
way to stay socially connected to them without making them
uncomfortable—this gives you a chance to have informal conversations
outside the normal work environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes it can be tricky to move into a management role over someone
who has been a good friend and a peer. If the friend who is
being managed is not self-managing and is not a hard worker,
it can be stressful for everyone. We recommend that you avoid getting
into this situation whenever possible.</p>

<h4 id="antipattern_compromise_the_hiring_bar">Antipattern: Compromise the Hiring Bar</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Steve Jobs once said: &#x201c;<em>A</em> people hire other
<em>A</em> people; <em>B</em> people hire <em>C</em> people." It&#8217;s incredibly easy to
fall victim to this adage, and even more so when you&#8217;re trying to hire
quickly. A common approach we&#8217;ve seen is that a team needs to hire
five engineers, so they sift through their pile of applications,
interview 40 or 50 people, and pick the best 5 <em>regardless of
whether they meet the hiring bar</em>. This is one of the fastest ways to
build a mediocre team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cost of finding the right person—whether by paying recruiters,
paying advertising, or pounding the pavement for references—pales in
comparison to the cost of dealing with an employee you never should
have hired in the first place. This "cost" manifests itself in lost
team productivity, team stress, time spent managing the employee up or
out, and the paperwork and stress involved in firing the
employee. That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you try to avoid the
monumental cost of just leaving him on the team. If you&#8217;re managing a
team where you don&#8217;t have a say over hiring and you&#8217;re unhappy with
the hires being made for your team, you need to fight tooth and nail
for higher-quality engineers. If you still keep getting handed
substandard engineers, maybe it&#8217;s time to look for another
job. Without the raw materials for a great team, you&#8217;re
doomed.</p>

<h4 id="antipattern_treat_your_team_like_childre">Antipattern: Treat Your Team Like Children</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way to show your team you don&#8217;t trust them is to treat them
like kids—people tend to act the way you treat them, so if you treat
them like children or prisoners, don&#8217;t be surprised when that&#8217;s how
they behave. You can manifest this behavior by micromanaging them or
simply by being disrespectful of their abilities and giving them no
opportunity to be responsible for their work. If it&#8217;s permanently
necessary to micromanage people because you don&#8217;t trust them, you&#8217;ve
got a hiring failure on your hands. Well, it&#8217;s a failure unless your
goal was to build a team that you can spend the rest of your life
babysitting. If you hire people worthy of trust and show these people
you trust them, they&#8217;ll usually rise to the occasion (sticking with
the basic premise, as we mentioned earlier, that you&#8217;ve hired good
people).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fitz runs a conference in Chicago that used to be at a site rented
from a local institution. The first time Fitz went to get access to
the venue for the conference, the facilities manager gave Fitz a brief
tour of the place to make sure he knew where everything was. The
manager then handed him the key to the building and told Fitz that
he&#8217;d get the key back from him next week. There was no list of "dos
and dont&#8217;s," and no extensive supervision for the event, and as a
result Fitz and his team felt responsible for taking take care of the
facility as though it were their own, going above and beyond the
expectations of keeping the place clean and organized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The results of this level of trust go all the way from keys to a
building to office and computer supplies. As another example, Google
provides employees with cabinets stocked with various and sundry
office supplies (e.g., pens, notebooks, and other "legacy" implements
of creation) that are free to take as employees need them. The IT
department runs numerous "Tech Stops" that provide self-service areas
that are like a mini electronics store. These contain lots of computer
accessories and doodads (e.g., power supplies, cables, mice, USB
drives, etc.) that would be easy to just grab and walk off with,
but since Google employees are being entrusted to check these items out,
they feel a responsibility to Do The Right Thing. Many people from
typical corporations react in horror to hearing this, exclaiming that
surely Google is hemorrhaging money due to people "stealing" these
items. That&#8217;s certainly possible, but what about the costs of having a
workforce that behaves like children? Surely that&#8217;s more
expensive than the price of a few pens and USB cables.</p>

<h3 id="leadership_patterns">Leadership Patterns</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are a collection of behavior patterns for successful leadership
that we&#8217;ve learned from experience, from watching other successful
leaders, and, most of all, from our own leadership mentors. These
patterns are not only those that we&#8217;ve had great success implementing,
but the patterns that we&#8217;ve always respected the most in the leaders
that we follow.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="lose_the_ego-id001">Lose the Ego</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We talked about "losing the ego" in
<a href="#the_myth_of_the_genius_programmer">The Myth of the Genius Programmer</a> when we first examined HRT, but
it&#8217;s especially important when you&#8217;re playing the role of servant
leader. This pattern is frequently misunderstood as encouraging
leaders to be a doormat and let their team walk all over them, but
that&#8217;s not the case at all. We admit that there&#8217;s a fine line between
being humble and letting others take advantage of you, but humility is
<em>not</em> the same as lacking confidence. You can still have
self-confidence and opinions without being an
egomaniac. Big personal egos are hard to handle on any team,
especially in the team&#8217;s leader. Instead, you should work to cultivate
a strong collective <em>team</em> ego and identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of "losing the ego" is
something we&#8217;ve covered already: you need to trust your team. That
means respecting the abilities and prior accomplishments of the team
members, even if they&#8217;re new to your team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re not micromanaging your team, you can be pretty certain the
folks working in the trenches know the details of their work better
than you do. This means that while you may be the one driving the team
to consensus and helping to set the direction, the nuts and bolts of
how to accomplish your goals are best decided by the people who are
putting the product together. This gives them not only a greater sense
of ownership, but also a greater sense of accountability and
responsibility for the success (or failure!) of their product. If
you&#8217;ve got a good team and you let them set the bar for the quality
and rate of their work, they&#8217;ll accomplish more than they would by you
standing over them with a carrot and a stick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people new to a leadership role feel an enormous responsibility
to get everything right, to know everything, and to have all the
answers. We can assure you that you will not get everything right, nor
will you have all the answers, and if you act like you do, you&#8217;ll
quickly lose the respect of your team. A lot of this comes down to
having a basic sense of security in your role. Think back to when you
were an individual contributor; you could smell insecurity a mile
away. Try to appreciate inquiry: when someone questions a decision or
statement you made, remember that this person is usually just trying
to better understand you. If you encourage inquiry, you&#8217;re much more
likely to get the kind of constructive
criticism that will make you a better leader of a better team. Finding
people who will give you good constructive criticism is incredibly difficult, and
it&#8217;s even harder to get this kind of criticism from people who "work
for you." Think about the big picture of what you&#8217;re trying to
accomplish as a team, and accept feedback and criticism openly; avoid
the urge to be territorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last part of losing the ego is a simple one,
but many engineers would rather be boiled in oil than do it: apologize
when you make a mistake. And we don&#8217;t mean you should just sprinkle
"I&#8217;m sorry" throughout your conversation like salt on popcorn—you have
to sincerely mean it. You are absolutely going to make mistakes, and
whether you admit it or not your team is going to know you&#8217;ve made a
mistake. They&#8217;ll know regardless of whether they talk to you or not
(and one thing is guaranteed: they <em>will</em> talk about it with one
another). Apologizing doesn&#8217;t cost
money. People have enormous respect for leaders who apologize when they screw up, and contrary
to popular belief it doesn&#8217;t make you vulnerable. In fact, you&#8217;ll
usually gain respect from people when you apologize, because
apologizing tells people you are level-headed, good at assessing
situations, and—coming back to HRT—humble.</p>

<p>As an engineer, you likely developed an excellent sense of skepticism
and cynicism, but this can be a liability when you&#8217;re trying to lead a
team. That&#8217;s not to say you should be naïvely optimistic at every
turn, but you would do well to be less vocally skeptical while still
letting your team know you&#8217;re aware of the intricacies and obstacles
involved in your work. Mediating your reactions and maintaining your
calm is more important as you lead more people, because your team will
(both unconsciously and consciously) look to you for clues on how to
act and react to whatever is going on around you.</p>

<p>A simple way to visualize this effect is to see your company&#8217;s org
chart as a chain of gears, with the individual contributor as a tiny
gear with just a few teeth all the
way at one end, and each successive manager above her as another gear,
ending with the CEO as the largest gear with many hundreds of
teeth. This means every time that individual&#8217;s "manager gear" (with
maybe a few dozen teeth) makes a single revolution, the "individual&#8217;s
gear" makes two or three revolutions. And the CEO can make a small
movement and send the hapless employee, at the end of a chain of six
or seven gears, spinning wildly! The farther you move up the chain,
the faster you can set the gears below you spinning, whether you
intend to or not.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking about this is the maxim that the <em>leader is
always on stage.</em> This means that if you&#8217;re in an overt leadership
position, you are always being watched: not just when you run a
meeting or give a talk, but even when you&#8217;re just sitting at your desk
answering emails.  Your peers are watching you for subtle clues in
your body language, your reactions to small talk, and your signals as
you eat lunch.  Do they read confidence or fear?  As a leader, your
job is to inspire, but inspiration is a 24/7 job.  Your visible
attitude about absolutely everything&#8212;&#8203;no matter how trivial&#8212;&#8203;is
unconsciously noticed and spreads infectiously to your team.</p>

<p>Fitz had a manager, Bill,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_33" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_33" title="View footnote.">33</a>]</sup>
who truly mastered the ability to maintain calm at all times. No
matter what blew up, no matter what crazy thing happened, no matter
how big the firestorm, Bill would never panic. Most of the time he&#8217;d
place one arm across his chest, rest his chin in his hand, and ask
questions about the problem, usually to a completely panicked
employee. This had the effect of calming her and helping her to focus
on solving the problem instead of running around in a
chicken-with-its-head-cut-off mode. Fitz used to joke that if someone
came in and told Bill 19 of the company&#8217;s offices had been attacked by
space aliens, Bill&#8217;s response would be, "Any idea why they didn&#8217;t make
it an even 20?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This brings us to another Zen
management trick: asking questions. When a team member asks you for
advice, it&#8217;s usually pretty exciting because you&#8217;re finally getting
the chance to fix something! That&#8217;s exactly what you did for years
before moving into a leadership position, so you usually go
<em>leaping</em> into solution mode, but that is the last place you should
be. The person asking for advice typically doesn&#8217;t want you to solve
her problem, but rather to help <em>her</em> solve it, and the easiest way
to do this is to ask her questions. This isn&#8217;t to say you should
replace yourself with a Magic 8 Ball, which would be maddening and
unhelpful. Instead, you can apply some HRT and try to help her solve
the problem on her own by trying to refine and explore her
problem. This will usually lead the employee to the
answer,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_34" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_34" title="View footnote.">34</a>]</sup> and it
will be <em>her</em> answer, which leads back to the ownership and
responsibility we went over earlier in this chapter. Whether you have
the answer or not, using this technique will almost always leave the
employee with the impression that you did. Tricky, eh? Socrates would

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In chemistry a catalyst is something that accelerates a chemical
reaction, but which itself is not consumed in the reaction. One of the
ways in which catalysts (e.g., enzymes) work is to bring
reactants into close proximity: instead of bouncing around randomly in
a solution, the reactants are much more likely to favorably interact
with one another when the catalyst helps bring them together. This is
a role you&#8217;ll often need to play as a leader, and there are a number
of ways you can go about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most common things a team leader does is to build
consensus. This may mean you drive the process from start to finish,
or you just give it a gentle push in the right direction to speed it
up. Working to build team consensus is a leadership skill that is
often used by unofficial leaders because it&#8217;s one
way you can lead without any actual authority. If you have the
authority, you can direct and dictate direction, but that&#8217;s less
effective overall than building consensus. If your team is looking to
move quickly, sometimes they&#8217;ll voluntarily concede authority and
direction to one or more team leads. While this might look like a
dictatorship or oligarchy, when it&#8217;s done voluntarily it&#8217;s a form of

eventually pulled out a worn piece of chalk and made a small X on the
side of the machine. He informed the technician that there was a loose
wire that needed repair at that very spot.  The technician opened the
machine and tightened the loose wire, thus fixing the problem. When
the Master&#8217;s invoice arrived for $10,000, the irate CEO wrote back
demanding a breakdown for this ridiculously high charge for a simple
chalk mark!  The Master responded with another invoice, showing a $1
cost for the chalk to make the mark, and $9,999 for knowing where to

direction.  Instead of micromanaging and trying to make continuous

evaluating risk, and most companies try to avoid risk at all costs. As
a result of this, the usual modus operandi is to work conservatively
and focus on smaller successes even when taking a bigger risk might
mean exponentially greater success. A common saying at Google is that
if you try to achieve an impossible goal, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll
fail, but if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you&#8217;ll most
likely accomplish way more than you would have accomplished had you

<p>So let&#8217;s get that out of the way: it&#8217;s OK to fail. In fact, we like to
think of failure as a way of learning a lot really quickly (providing
that you&#8217;re not repeatedly failing at the same thing). In addition,
it&#8217;s important to see failure as an opportunity to learn and not to
point fingers or assign blame. Failing fast is good, because there&#8217;s
not a lot at stake.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_35" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_35" title="View footnote.">35</a>]</sup> Failing slowly can also teach a valuable
lesson, but it is more painful because more is at risk and more can be
lost (usually engineering time). Failing in a manner that affects your
customers is probably the least desirable failure that we encounter,
and one where we have the greatest amount of structure in place to
learn from failures. As mentioned earlier, every time there is a
production failure at Google, they perform a postmortem. This
procedure is a way to document the events that led to the actual
failure and to develop a series of steps that will prevent it from
happening in the future. This is not an opportunity to point fingers,
nor is it intended to introduce unnecessary bureaucratic checks; the goal is rather to focus strongly on the core of the problem and fix it once
and for all. It&#8217;s very difficult, but quite effective (and
<span class="keep-together">cathartic</span>!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individual successes and failures are a bit different. It&#8217;s one thing
to laud individual successes, but looking to assign individual blame
in the case of failure is a great way to divide a team and discourage
risk taking across the board. It&#8217;s
OK to fail, but fail as a team and learn from your failures. If an
individual succeeds, praise him in front of the team. If an individual
fails, give constructive criticism in
private.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_36" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_36" title="View footnote.">36</a>]</sup> Whatever the
case, take advantage of the opportunity and apply a liberal helping of
HRT to help your team to learn from their failures.</p>

<h4 id="be_a_teacher_and_a_mentor">Be a Teacher and a Mentor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the hardest things to do as a team leader is to watch a more
junior-level team member spend three hours working on something you
<em>know</em> you can knock out in 20 minutes. Teaching people and giving
them a chance to learn on their own can be incredibly difficult at
first, but it&#8217;s a vital component of effective leadership. This is
especially important for new hires who, in addition to learning your
team&#8217;s technology and code base, are learning your team&#8217;s culture and
the appropriate level of responsibility to assume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much like the role of manager, most people don&#8217;t apply for the role of
mentor—they usually become one when a team lead is looking for someone
to mentor a new team member. It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of formal education
or preparation to be a mentor; in fact, you primarily need three
things: experience with your team&#8217;s processes and systems, the ability
to explain things to someone else, and the ability to gauge how much
help your mentee needs. The last thing is probably the most
important—giving your mentee enough information is what you&#8217;re
supposed to be doing, but if you overexplain things or ramble on
endlessly, your mentee will probably tune you out rather than politely
tell you she got it.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="set_clear_goals">Set Clear Goals</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is one of those patterns that, as obvious as it sounds, is solidly
ignored by an enormous number of leaders. If
you&#8217;re going to get your team moving rapidly in one direction, you
need to make sure they all understand and agree on what the direction
is. Imagine your product is a big truck (and not a series of
tubes). Each team member has in his hand a rope tied to the front of
the truck, and as he works on the product, he&#8217;ll pull the truck in
his own direction. If your intention is to pull the truck (or
product) northbound as quickly as possible, you can&#8217;t have team
members pulling every which way—you want them all pulling the truck
north.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id020" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_03in06.png" alt="dbtm 03in06">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to set a clear goal and get your team pulling the
product in the same direction is to create a concise mission statement
for the team (see the section <a href="#the_mission_statementmdashno_really">The Mission Statement—No, Really</a>
in <a href="#building_an_awesome_team_culture">Building an Awesome Team Culture</a> for more information about
mission
statements). Once you&#8217;ve helped the team define their direction and
goals, you can step back and give them more autonomy, periodically
checking in to make sure they&#8217;re still on the right track. This not
only frees up your time to handle other leadership tasks, but it also
<em>drastically increases the efficiency of your team</em>. Teams can (and do) succeed
without clear goals, but they typically waste a great deal of energy
as each team member pulls the product in a slightly different
direction. This frustrates you, slows progress for the team, and
forces you to use more and more of your own energy to correct the
course.</p>

<h4 id="be_honest">Be Honest</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re assuming you are lying to your team, but it
merits a mention because you&#8217;ll inevitably find yourself in a position
where you can&#8217;t tell your team something or, even worse, you have to
tell them something they don&#8217;t want to hear. A former manager of
Fitz&#8217;s would tell new team members, "I won&#8217;t lie to you, but I will
tell you when I can&#8217;t tell you something or if I just don&#8217;t know."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a team member approaches you about something you can&#8217;t share with
her, it&#8217;s OK to just tell her you know the answer but can&#8217;t tell
her. Even more common is when a team member asks you something you
don&#8217;t know the answer to: you can tell her you don&#8217;t know. This is
another one of those things that seems blindingly obvious when you
read it, but many people move to a manager role and feel that if they
don&#8217;t know the answer to something it proves they&#8217;re weak or out of
touch. In reality, the only thing it proves is that they&#8217;re human.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Giving hard feedback is…well,
<em>hard</em>. The first time you have to tell one of your reports that he
made a mistake or didn&#8217;t do his job as well as was expected of him can
be incredibly stressful. Most management texts advise that you use the
"compliment sandwich" to soften the blow when
delivering hard feedback. A compliment sandwich looks
something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>"You&#8217;re a solid member of the team and one of our smartest
engineers. That being said, your code is incredibly convoluted and
almost impossible for anyone else on the team to understand. But
you&#8217;ve got great potential and a wicked cool neckbeard."</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sure, this softens the blow, but with this sort of beating around the
bush most people will walk out of this meeting only thinking, "Sweet!
I&#8217;ve got a wicked cool beard!" We <em>strongly</em> advise against using
the compliment sandwich, not because we think you should be
unnecessarily cruel or harsh, but <em>because most people won&#8217;t hear the
critical message</em>, which is that something needs to change. It&#8217;s
possible to employ HRT here: be kind and empathetic when delivering
constructive criticism without resorting to the compliment
sandwich. In fact, kindness and empathy are <em>critical</em> if you want
the recipient to hear the criticism and not immediately go on the
defensive.</p>

<img src="images/dbtm_03in07.png" alt="dbtm 03in07">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Years ago, Fitz picked up a team member, Tim, from another manager who
insisted that Tim was impossible to work with. He told Fitz that Tim
never responded to feedback or criticism and instead just kept doing the same
things he&#8217;d been told he shouldn&#8217;t do. Fitz sat in on a few of the
manager&#8217;s meetings with Tim to watch the interaction between the
manager and Tim, and he noticed that the manager made extensive use of
the compliment sandwich so
as not to hurt Tim&#8217;s feelings. When Fitz took Tim on his team, he sat
down with him and very clearly explained that Tim needed to make some
changes to work more effectively with the team. Fitz didn&#8217;t give Tim
any compliments or candy-coat the issue, but just as importantly, Fitz
wasn&#8217;t mean—he just laid out the facts as he saw them based on Tim&#8217;s
performance with the previous team. Lo and behold, within a matter of
weeks (and after a few more "refresher" meetings), Tim&#8217;s performance
improved dramatically. Tim just needed very clear feedback and <span class="keep-together">direction</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re providing direct feedback or criticism, your delivery is key to
making sure your message is heard and not deflected. If you put the
recipient on the defensive, he&#8217;s not going to be thinking of how he
can change, but rather how he can argue with you to show you you&#8217;re
wrong. Ben once managed an engineer we&#8217;ll call Dean. Dean had
extremely strong opinions and would argue with the rest of the team
about <em>anything</em>. It could be something as big as the team&#8217;s mission
or as small as the placement of a widget on a web page; Dean would
argue with the same conviction and vehemence either way, and he
refused to let anything slide. After months of this behavior, Ben met
with Dean to explain to him that he was being too combative. Now, if Ben had just
said, "Dean, stop being such a jerk," you can be pretty sure Dean would have disregarded it entirely. Ben
thought hard about how he could get Dean to understand how his actions
were adversely affecting the team, and he came up with the following
metaphor:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every time a decision is made, it&#8217;s like a train coming through
town—when you jump in front of the train to stop it you slow the train
down and potentially annoy the engineer driving the train. A new train
comes by every 15 minutes, and if you jump in front of every train,
not only do you spend a lot of your time stopping trains, but
eventually one of the engineers driving the train is going to get mad
enough to run right over you. So, while it&#8217;s OK to jump in front of
some trains, pick and choose the ones you want to stop to make sure
you&#8217;re only stopping the trains that really matter.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This anecdote not only injected a bit of humor into the situation, but
also made it easier for Ben and Dean to discuss the effect that Dean&#8217;s
"train stopping" was having on the team
in addition to the energy Dean was spending on
it.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="track_happiness">Track Happiness</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a leader, one way you can make your team more productive (and less
likely to leave) in the long term is to take some time to gauge their happiness. The best
leaders we&#8217;ve worked with have all been
amateur psychologists, looking in on their team members' welfare from
time to time, making sure they get recognition for what they do, and
trying to make certain they are happy with their work. One leader we
know makes a spreadsheet of all the grungy, thankless tasks that need
to be done and makes certain these tasks are evenly spread across the
team. Another leader watches the hours his team is working and uses
comp time and fun team outings to avoid burnout and exhaustion. Yet
another leader starts one-on-one sessions with his team members by
dealing with their technical issues as a way to break the ice, and
then takes some time to make sure each engineer has everything he
needs to get his work done. After they&#8217;ve warmed up, he talks to the
engineer for a bit about how he&#8217;s enjoying the work he&#8217;s doing and
what he&#8217;s looking forward to next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most valuable tools in tracking your team&#8217;s happiness is, at the end
of each one-on-one meeting, to ask the team member, "What do you need?" This simple question is a great way to wrap up and make
sure each team member has what he needs to be productive and happy,
although you may need to carefully probe a bit to get details. If you
ask this every time you have a one-on-one, you&#8217;ll find that eventually
your team will remember this and sometimes even come to you with a
laundry list of things they need to make their job better.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">The Unexpected Question</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shortly after Fitz started at Google he had his first meeting with
then-CEO Eric Schmidt, and at the end Eric asked
Fitz, "Is there anything you need?" Fitz, who had prepared a million
defensive responses to hard questions or challenges, was <em>completely</em>
unprepared for this. So he sat there dumbstruck and staring. But you
can be sure Fitz had something ready the next time he was asked that
question!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can also be worthwhile to pay some attention to your team&#8217;s
happiness <em>outside</em> the office. Be wary of assuming that people have no life outside of work—having
unrealistic expectations
about the amount of time people can put into their work will cause
people to lose respect for you, or worse, to burn out. We&#8217;re not
advocating that you pry into your team members' personal lives, but
being sensitive to personal situations that your team members are
going through can give you a lot of insight into why they may be more
or less productive at any given time. Giving a little extra slack to a
team member who is having a tough time at home now can make him a lot
more willing to put in longer hours when your team has a tight
deadline to hit later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A big part of tracking your team members' happiness is
tracking their careers. If you ask a team member where she sees her
career in five years, most of the time you&#8217;ll get a shrug and a blank
look. When put on the spot, most people won&#8217;t say much about this, but
there are usually a few things that everyone would like to do in the
next five years: get promoted, learn something new, launch something
important, and work with smart
people. Regardless of whether they verbalize this, most people are
thinking about it. If you&#8217;re going to be an effective leader, you
should be thinking about how you can help make all those things happen
and let your team know you&#8217;re thinking about this. The most important
part of this is to take these implicit goals and make them
<em>explicit</em> so that when you&#8217;re giving career advice you have a real
set of metrics on which to evaluate situations and opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tracking happiness comes down to not just monitoring
careers, but also giving your team members opportunities to improve
themselves, get recognized for the work they do, and have a little fun
along the way.</p>

<h4 id="other_tips_and_tricks">Other Tips and Tricks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Delegate, but get your hands dirty</em>. When moving from an individual
contributor role to a leadership role, achieving a balance is one of
the hardest things to do: initially, you&#8217;re inclined to do all of the
work yourself, and after being in a leadership role for a long time,
it&#8217;s easy to get into the habit of doing <em>none</em> of the work
yourself. If you&#8217;re new to a leadership role, you probably need to
work hard to delegate work to other engineers on your team, even if it
will take them a lot longer than you to accomplish that work. Not only
is this one way for you to maintain your sanity, but also it&#8217;s how the
rest of your team will learn. If you&#8217;ve been leading teams for a while
or if you pick up a new team, one of the easiest ways to gain the
team&#8217;s respect and get up to speed on what they&#8217;re doing is to get
your hands dirty—usually by taking on a grungy task no one else wants
to do. You can have a résumé and a list of achievements a mile long,
but nothing lets a team know how skillful and dedicated (and humble)
you are like jumping in and actually doing some hard
work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Seek to replace yourself</em>. Unless you want to keep doing the exact
same job for the rest of your career, seek to replace yourself. This
starts, as we mentioned earlier, with the hiring process: if you want
a member of your team to replace you, you need to hire people capable
of replacing you, which we usually sum up by saying you need to "hire
people smarter than you." Once you have team members capable of doing
your job, you need to give them opportunities to take on more
responsibilities or occasionally lead the team. If you do this, you&#8217;ll
quickly see who has the most aptitude to lead as well as who <em>wants</em>
to lead the team. Remember that some people prefer to just be
high-performing individual contributors, and that&#8217;s OK. We&#8217;ve always
been amazed at companies that take their best engineers and—against
their wishes—throw these engineers into management roles. This usually
subtracts a great engineer from your team and adds a subpar manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Know when to make waves</em>. You will (inevitably and frequently) have
difficult situations crop up where every cell in your body is
screaming at you to do nothing about it. It may be the engineer on
your team whose technical chops aren&#8217;t up to par. It may be the person
who jumps in front of every train. It may be the unmotivated employee
who is working 30 hours a week. "Just wait a bit and it will get
better," you&#8217;ll tell yourself. "It will work itself out," you&#8217;ll
rationalize. Don&#8217;t fall into this trap—these are the situations where
you <em>need</em> to make the biggest waves and you need to make them
now. Rarely will these problems work themselves out, and the longer
you wait to address them, the more they&#8217;ll adversely affect the rest
of the team and the more they&#8217;ll keep you up at night thinking about
them. By waiting, you&#8217;re only delaying the inevitable and causing
untold damage in the process. So act, and act quickly.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Shield your team from chaos</em>. When you step into a leadership role,
the first thing you&#8217;ll usually discover is that outside your team is a
world of chaos and uncertainty (or even insanity) that you never saw
when you were an individual contributor. When Fitz first became a
manager back in the 1990s (before going back to being an individual
contributor) he was taken aback by the sheer volume of uncertainty and
organizational chaos that was happening in his company. He asked
another manager what had caused this sudden rockiness in the otherwise
calm company, and the other manager laughed hysterically at Fitz&#8217;s
naïveté: the chaos had always been present, but Fitz&#8217;s previous
manager had shielded Fitz and the rest of the team from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Give your team air cover</em>. While it&#8217;s important that you keep your
team informed about what&#8217;s going on "above" them in the company, it&#8217;s
just as important that you defend them from a lot of the uncertainty
and frivolous demands that may be imposed upon you from outside your
team. Share as much information as you can with your team, but don&#8217;t
distract them with organizational craziness that is extremely unlikely
to ever actually affect them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Let your team know when they&#8217;re doing well</em>. Many new team leads
can get so caught up in dealing with the shortcomings of their team
members that they neglect to provide positive feedback often
enough. Just as you let someone know when he screws up, be sure to let
him know when he does well, and be sure to let him (and the rest of
the team) know when he knocks one out of the
park.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, here&#8217;s something the best leaders
know and use often when they have adventurous team members who want to
try new things often: it&#8217;s easy to say "yes" if it&#8217;s easy to undo
something. If you have a team member who wants to take a day or two to
try using a new tool or library that could speed up your product (and
you&#8217;re not on a tight deadline), it&#8217;s easy to say, "Sure, give it a
shot." If, on the other hand, she wants to do something like launch a
product that you&#8217;re going to have to support for the next 10 years,
you&#8217;ll likely want to give it a bit more thought. Really good leaders
have a good sense for when something can be undone.</p>

phenomenon,"<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_37" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_37" title="View footnote.">37</a>]</sup> which
according to Wikipedia is a <em>"psychological phenomenon in which

external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain
convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they
have achieved."</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We prefer the "phenomenon" nomenclature because, even though this may
make you feel like a fraud who will be discovered at any time, the imposter

<p>This problem is extremely common in people new to management,
especially those thrust into leadership positions (official or not) by
necessity.  The phenomenon is so widespread that we almost always get
asked about it after our talks.  <em>"I don&#8217;t actually know what I&#8217;m
doing,"</em> people will say, <em>"so what can I do to stop feeling like a
phony?"</em> Our answer is that everyone feels like a phony at some point
in their career; one could even argue that a little bit of insecurity
makes us work harder and helps improve our success.</p>

<p>Ben likes to share the story of his parents' marriage. The night
before they got married, they both got cold feet and admitted to each
other that they had made a Terrible Mistake&#8212;&#8203;but that it was clearly

maybe call things off a few days later.  A couple of weeks later, they
decided to try another month of marriage.  And then the month after

<p>Fitz&#8217;s wife is the youngest of six children, and her mother was faced
with the difficult task of figuring out how to raise six <em>very
different</em> children, each of whom needed different things. Fitz asked
his mother-in-law how she managed this (see what we did there?), and
she responded that kids are like plants: some are like cactuses and
need little water but lots of sunshine, others are like African
violets and need diffuse light and moist soil, and still others are
like tomatoes and will truly excel if you give them a little
fertilizer. If you have six kids and give each one the same amount of
water, light, and fertilizer, they&#8217;ll all get equal treatment, but the

<p>And so your team members are also like plants: some need more light,

<p>To get all of your team members into the sweet spot, you need to
motivate the ones who fall into the "In a rut" portion of the matrix,
and provide stronger direction to those who are in the "Look!
Squirrel!" portion. Of course, those who are "adrift" need both
motivation <em>and</em> direction. So, instead of
water and sunlight, you need to provide team members with a
combination of motivation and direction to make them happy and
productive. And you don&#8217;t want to give them too much of either—because
if they don&#8217;t need motivation or direction and you try giving it to
them, you&#8217;re just going to annoy them.</p>

<p>Giving direction is fairly straightforward—it requires a basic

<p>A person has <em>autonomy</em> when she has the ability to act on her own
without someone micromanaging her.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_40" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_40" title="View footnote.">40</a>]</sup> With autonomous employees, you might give them the
general direction in which they need to take the product, but leave it
up to them to decide how to get there. This helps with motivation not
only because they have a closer relationship with the product (and
likely know better than you how to build it), but also because it
gives them a much greater sense of ownership of the product. The
bigger their stake is in the success of the product, the greater their
interest is in seeing it succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Mastery</em> in its basest form simply means you need to give someone
the opportunity to learn new skills and improve existing
skills. Giving ample opportunities for mastery not only helps to
motivate people, but also makes them better over time, which makes for
stronger teams.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_41" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_41" title="View footnote.">41</a>]</sup> An
employee&#8217;s skills are like the blade of a knife: you may spend tens of
thousands of dollars to find people with the sharpest skills for your
team, but if you "use" that knife for years without sharpening it, you
will wind up with a dull knife that is inefficient, and in some cases
useless. Ample opportunities for team members to learn new things and
master their craft will keep them sharp, efficient, and
effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, all the autonomy and mastery in the world isn&#8217;t going to
help motivate someone if she&#8217;s doing work for no reason at all, which
is why you need to give her work <em>purpose</em>. Many people work on
products that have great significance, but they are kept at arm&#8217;s
length from the positive effects their products may have on their
company, their customers, or even the world. Even in cases where the
product may have a much smaller impact, you can motivate your team by
seeking the reason for their efforts and making this reason clear to
them. If you can help them to see this purpose in their work, you&#8217;ll
see a tremendous increase in their motivation and
productivity.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_42" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_42" title="View footnote.">42</a>]</sup> One manager we know keeps a close eye on the
email feedback the company gets for its product (one of the
"smaller-impact" products), and whenever she sees a message from a
customer talking about how the company&#8217;s product has helped the
customer personally or helped the customer&#8217;s business, she immediately
forwards it to the engineering team. This not only motivates the team,
but also frequently inspires them to think about ways they can make
their product even better.</p>

<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of whether you ever intend to lead a team, we hope this
chapter has helped you understand what it takes to be a good team
leader and dispelled some of the myths about what a leader does for a
team. Even if you&#8217;re resolute in your commitment to never be a leader,
it&#8217;s good to be familiar with the concepts laid out in this chapter
because they can help you understand why the leader of <em>your</em> team
does what she does, regardless of whether she&#8217;s good at her job or
terrible at it. Take a moment to look at your team and see which of
these patterns and antipatterns your team leader applies to make your
team succeed (or fail), and you&#8217;ll have a more concrete understanding
of what makes your team tick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But understanding the team and leader you work with every day is only
one aspect of working with other people—crossing paths with someone
outside your team can be even more challenging, especially if this
person is out to sabotage your team. We call these "poisonous people,"
and we discuss them in the following chapter.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="dealing_with_poisonous_people">Dealing with Poisonous People</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the opening quote of our book suggests, the hardest part of
creative work is <em>people</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up until now, we&#8217;ve taken an introspective approach. We began with an
examination of your own private behaviors and how to focus them on the
principles of humility, respect, and trust (HRT). We then explored
ways to build a communicative team culture around these concepts. In
the preceding chapter, we explained how to mold yourself into an
effective leader of such a team, should the need arise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the second half of this book we&#8217;re going to shift gears and start
looking outward. How does your team interact with people <em>outside</em>
your immediate group? There are almost always folks wishing to join or
collaborate with your team. There are issues in dealing with the
politics of your larger organization. And, of course, you need to have
a plan for dealing with the most important outsiders of all: the users
of your software!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we&#8217;ll discuss the importance of preventing
destructive outsiders from trashing the cooperative culture your team
has worked hard to build. Perhaps more importantly, we&#8217;ll also talk
about how to deal with poisonous people already on your team.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="defining_poisonous">Defining "Poisonous"</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve already reviewed the importance of building a solid,
communicative team culture. We spent most of the time talking about
what a good culture should include: things like consensus-based
development, high-quality code, code reviews, and an environment where
people feel comfortable enough to try new things and to fail
fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as important is the need to talk about what your culture should
<em>not</em> include. If you&#8217;re trying to build a highly efficient,
fast-moving team, it&#8217;s important to focus on what you <em>don&#8217;t</em>
want. While brilliant engineers can make your team faster and more
efficient, certain antibehaviors can make your team slower and less
efficient, and make your company a less comfortable place to work—and
eventually erode the bonds that hold the team together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we first began speaking about the social challenges of software
development, we came up with a presentation titled "How to Deal with
Bad Eggs." A conference chair suggested we rename the talk to "How
Projects Survive Poisonous People," with the hope that a more
sensational title would draw a bigger audience. And he was right: we
gave the presentation over and over at different conferences to
standing-room-only crowds. It&#8217;s not just the negativity of a word like
<em>poisonous</em> that attracted people, but the fact that everyone seems
to have some sort of personal experience in dealing with irritating
people. The talks would almost always turn into a group therapy
session, with audience members swapping war stories and seeking
advice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there&#8217;s a danger here. In general, it&#8217;s not healthy to spend your
time stewing in an ocean of negativity—it tends to eat you up and can
create more conflicts in the long run.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_43" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_43" title="View footnote.">43</a>]</sup> The term <em>poisonous person</em> is a nasty label and
automatically creates a dividing line between "us" (the good guys) and
"them" (those nasty jerks). There&#8217;s a better way to think about the
problem. Instead of running your team as an elite fraternity with a
mission to "repel mean people," it&#8217;s healthier to create a culture
that simply refuses to tolerate certain negative behaviors. It&#8217;s the
<em>behaviors</em> you want to filter out, not particular individuals. It&#8217;s
naïve to think of individuals as purely good or bad; it&#8217;s more
constructive and practical to identify and reprimand the intolerable
behaviors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now, we&#8217;ll continue to use the term <em>poisonous person</em> as a
simplifying piece of rhetoric, one that refers to a person who isn&#8217;t
behaving well. In practice, though, this is not a term you&#8217;d want to
use in everyday conversations!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="fortifying_your_team">Fortifying Your Team</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall our yeast metaphor: how a team culture grows from an important
starter culture. The biggest single influence
on the long-term culture of your team is the team you start with, and
if the founding team doesn&#8217;t establish a strong enough culture,
strains of other cultures will overgrow it. If your starter team
builds a strong sense of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, these
expectations will endure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two of us have spent a lot of time in the world of open source
projects, and our own experiences jibe with this idea pretty strongly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project we were most involved with—Subversion—was started by a
very small group of people. They had a lot of humility and naturally
trusted and respected one another. After 15-plus years, the project
has gone through at least three or four generations of participants
(the founders are mostly gone), and yet the same culture
persists—everyone is kind, is polite, and expects that same behavior
from everyone else. The culture perpetuates not just because of high
standards, but because cultures tend to be <em>self-selecting</em>. Nice
people tend to be attracted to existing nice
communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Self-selection can easily work in the other direction as well. When a
team is started by a group of angry jerks, the effort tends to attract
more and more individuals of the same sort. Certain projects that we
won&#8217;t mention here (like the Linux kernel community) are keen examples
of this—full of endless bickering and chest thumping. Yes, the team
may get a lot of work done, but the overall <em>efficiency</em> of its
operation is doubtful. How much more work would get done if so much
energy weren&#8217;t being spent on personal attacks? How much potential
contribution is lost because polite people are being driven away at
the front door?</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id025" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_04in01.png" alt="dbtm 04in01">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We bring up this topic again because you need to understand what&#8217;s at
stake: poisonous
people are a direct threat to your high-functioning team. If you allow
bad behaviors to persist, not only does your productivity decrease,
but you may also find your culture slowly changing for the worse. The
best defense is to fortify your culture through a strong set of best
practices and procedures. We covered them in
<a href="#building_an_awesome_team_culture">Building an Awesome Team Culture</a>, but here&#8217;s a quick refresher:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have a visible mission statement, to keep you focused on both your
goals and nongoals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish proper etiquette around email
discussions. Keep archives, get newcomers to read them, and prevent
filibustering by noisy minorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document all history: not just code history, but also design
decisions, important bug fixes, and prior mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate effectively. Use version control, keep code changes
small and reviewable, and spread the "bus factor"
around to prevent territoriality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have clear policies and procedures around fixing bugs, testing, and releasing software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streamline the barrier to entry for newcomers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rely on consensus-based decisions, but also have a fallback process
for resolving conflicts when consensus can&#8217;t be reached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bottom line is that the more ingrained these best practices are,
the more intolerant of poisonous behavior your community will be. When
troublemakers arrive, you&#8217;ll be ready.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="identifying_the_threat">Identifying the Threat</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re going to defend your team against poisonous people, the first thing you need to
do is to understand exactly what constitutes a threat and when you
should become concerned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s specifically at risk is your team&#8217;s <em>attention</em> and
<em>focus</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attention and focus are the scarcest resources you have. The bigger
the team, the more capacity the team has to focus on building things
and solving interesting problems—but it&#8217;s always a finite amount. If
you don&#8217;t actively protect these things, it&#8217;s easy for poisonous
people to disrupt your team&#8217;s flow. Your team ends up bickering,
distracted, and emotionally drained. Everyone ends up spending all
their attention and focus on things <em>other</em> than creating a great
<span class="keep-together">product</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id026" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_04in02.png" alt="dbtm 04in02">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, one has to wonder: what does a poisonous person look like?
To defend yourself, you need to know what to look out
for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our experiences, it&#8217;s rare to find people who are deliberately
being malicious (i.e., are trying to be jerks on purpose). We call
such people "trolls" and typically ignore them. Most
people who behave badly, however, either don&#8217;t realize it or simply
don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s more an issue of ignorance or apathy, rather than
malice. Most of the bad
behaviors boil down to a simple lack of HRT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some classic signals and patterns to watch for. Whenever we
see these patterns, we talk about "flipping the bozo bit" on the person—that is, we make a mental note that the
person is consistently exhibiting poisonous behaviors and that we should be
extremely careful in dealing with her.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="not_respecting_other_peoples_time">Lack of Respect for Other People&#8217;s Time</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are certain people out there who simply are unable to figure out
what&#8217;s going on in a project. Their damage is most often in the form
of wasting the team&#8217;s time. Rather than spending a few minutes of
their own time reading fundamental project documentation, mission
statements, FAQs, or the latest email discussion threads, they
repeatedly distract the entire team with questions about things they
could easily figure out on their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Subversion project, we once had a participant who decided to
use the main developer discussion forum as a sounding board for his
daily stream of consciousness. Charlie made no actual code
contribution. Instead, every two or three hours, he&#8217;d send out his
latest daydreams and brainstorms. There would inevitably be multiple
responses explaining why his ideas were incorrect, impossible, already
in progress, previously discussed, and/or already documented. To make
things worse, Charlie even started answering questions from drive-by
users, and answering them <em>incorrectly</em>. Core contributors had to
repeatedly correct his replies. It took us quite a while to realize
that this affable, enthusiastic participant was in fact poisonous and draining our collective energy.
Later in this chapter we&#8217;ll talk about how we dealt with the
situation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ego">Ego</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps <em>ego</em> isn&#8217;t the perfect word here, but we&#8217;re using the term
to describe anyone who is incapable of accepting a consensus decision,
listening to or respecting other points of view, or reaching compromises. This
person will typically reopen discussions that have been long settled
(and documented in email archives) because she wasn&#8217;t around to
participate in the decision. The person won&#8217;t read or think about the
history at all, demanding that the debate be replayed just for her
sake. She will often make sweeping claims about the project&#8217;s success,
claiming that doom is imminent unless she gets her way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Subversion project had a notable episode in which an intelligent
programmer showed up on the email list one day and declared that the
entire product was ill-designed. He had seen the light, had radical
ideas about how things should work, and insisted that the entire
project start over from scratch. He even helpfully volunteered to lead
the reboot himself. Without his leadership, he proclaimed that
complete failure was looming just around the
corner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An entire week was wasted while the project founders endlessly argued
with this person and defended their original design decisions. A huge
amount of attention and focus was lost. It became clear that this
person wasn&#8217;t willing to compromise or integrate any of his ideas into
the current product, and the product (which was already in beta and
being used in the wild) wasn&#8217;t about to start over. At some point we
simply had to walk away from the debate and get back on
track. Ironically, years later, this person&#8217;s predictions turned out
to be correct on many levels, but that didn&#8217;t stop Subversion from
becoming wildly successful anyway—at least in corporate software
development. The point here isn&#8217;t about who is right or wrong, but
whether a disagreement is guaranteed to come to a conclusion and
whether it&#8217;s worthwhile to keep a debate going. Never stop asking
yourself those sorts of questions; at some point you need to decide
when it&#8217;s time to cut your losses and move on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="Entitlement">Entitlement</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anytime you have a visitor who <em>demands</em> that something be done,
your alarm should go off. Something is wrong with a person who puts
all her energy into complaining about the inadequacies of the
software but is unwilling to directly contribute in any
way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sense of entitlement sometimes bleeds into troll-like
behavior. While running Google&#8217;s Project Hosting service, we once had
a project owner ask us to ban a user for obscene behavior. The open
source project, a video game emulator, didn&#8217;t work properly for his
favorite video game. The user started by filing a rather rude bug in
the issue tracker. The project developers politely explained why the
game didn&#8217;t work yet, and why it was unlikely to be fixed for a good
while. This answer was unacceptable to the user, who began to harass
the developers daily. He would open bug after bug with the same
complaint. He started adding comments to <em>other</em> bugs saying what
"idiots" the developers were for refusing to fix his problem. His
language became increasingly obscene over time, despite repeated
warnings from the developers and Google administrators. Regardless of
all our efforts to eliminate his destructive behavior, he steadfastly
refused to change, so we were eventually forced—as a last resort—to
ban him entirely.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="immature_or_confusing_communication">Immature or Confusing Communication</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The person doesn&#8217;t use her real name. Instead, you&#8217;ll see only
childish nicknames like "SuperCamel," "jubjub89," or "SirHacksalot."
To make things worse, often the person will have different nicknames
in different media—one name for email, a different one for instant
messaging, and perhaps a different one for code submissions. In
extreme cases, you&#8217;ll see these people communicating in lol-speak,
1337speak, ALL CAPS, or with excessive
punctuation!??!1!!1!!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="paranoia">Paranoia</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As seen in the earlier example, sometimes an inappropriate sense of entitlement
leads directly into open hostility toward a project. Many times we see
it escalate into complete paranoia. When an existing
team disagrees with the visitor, the poisonous person will sometimes
start to throw accusations of a "cabal" and conspiracy. It&#8217;s amusing
to imagine that the project team finds him so important that they&#8217;d
go through the effort of conspiring against the visitor. And if you
already have an open and transparent culture of communication (as we
pushed for in <a href="#building_an_awesome_team_culture">Building an Awesome Team Culture</a>), this makes the
accusation all the more hilarious, since every conversation is already
a public record. The recommendation here is to not even bother
responding to such charges. By the time the poisonous person goes this far over the edge, anything
you say will only dig yourself a deeper hole in his mind, so why
bother saying anything at all? It&#8217;s time to get back to the important
work of making things.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="perfectionism">Perfectionism</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the surface, perfectionists don&#8217;t seem dangerous at all. Sure,
there may be a touch of odd obsessive-compulsive behavior now and then, but usually
the person is humble, polite, respectful, and a good listener. He
seems stuffed full of happy HRT and good intentions. What&#8217;s the
problem, then? The problem is the threat of paralysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at a person we&#8217;ve worked with in the past. Patrick was a
brilliant engineer. He had great design chops, wrote high-quality code
and tests, and was easy to get along with. Unfortunately, when it came
time to design new software, he could spend the rest of his life
tweaking and improving his design. He was never satisfied with the
plans and seemingly was never ready to start coding. While he
certainly had good points and excellent insights into the problems we
were trying to solve, the rest of the team ended up becoming immensely
frustrated; it became clear that we were never actually going to write
any code. Several of us on the project deliberated quite a bit on what
to do about this. On the one hand, Patrick was a huge help to our
team. On the other hand, he was preventing us from making forward
progress as a group. Every time we&#8217;d begin to code he&#8217;d politely veto
and point out potential theoretical problems that could matter in the
distant future. He was paralyzing us without realizing it. We&#8217;ll talk
about how we resolved this in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="repelling_the_poison">Repelling the Poison</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t advocate throwing people out of a community just because
they&#8217;re being antisocial or rude. As we mentioned earlier, it&#8217;s not
healthy to create a clique focused on "us" (the nice people) versus
"them" (the mean people). In our prior examples we didn&#8217;t focus on
booting the person, but rather on booting the <em>behavior</em>. Make it
clear that bad behaviors will not be tolerated. If, after repeated
warnings, the behavior doesn&#8217;t change, only then does it makes sense
to consider formal rejection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concentrating your effort on removing toxic behavior is often enough
to turn an intelligent (although perhaps socially awkward) person into
a productive member of your team. A few years ago we had a team member
who was an excellent engineer but had an annoying habit of
accidentally insulting teammates. Rather than just ejecting him from
the community, one of us pulled him aside and asked him if he was
aware that his words were alienating people. He seemed somewhat
surprised that this was happening and didn&#8217;t exactly understand why
his actions were having this effect. But he agreed that it would be
worthwhile to try to temper his actions in the interest of being a
better team member. And everything worked out perfectly. He changed
his behavior, and the problem was resolved. Not every anecdote ends in
exile!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, so you&#8217;ve identified a poisonous person. Perhaps there&#8217;s someone
distracting and draining your team&#8217;s energy right now. How do you deal
effectively with the situation? Here are some useful strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="redirect_the_energy_of_perfectionists">Redirect the Energy of Perfectionists</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a good-enough solution is found for the original problem, point
the perfectionist to a different problem that still needs attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of Subversion&#8217;s perfectionist, this strategy worked
well. Eventually, we reached a point where we took Patrick aside and
said, "OK, we&#8217;re just going to start working from this design as it
stands now, and see what happens. Hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to help us
navigate around any problems that crop up down the road." To our
surprise, Patrick was OK with this and instead moved on to a different
subject as the object of his obsession. No feelings were hurt either
way, and Patrick kept contributing to the overall effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s an old saying to not let "the perfect be the enemy of the
good," and in your quest to create a high-performing team, you need to
be just as vigilant about avoiding perfectionism as you are about calling out more
obvious disruptive behaviors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This trick of redirecting energy
also works on the overly entitled people who spend more time
complaining and criticizing than helping out. It&#8217;s tempting to respond
to such a person with a standard "patches welcome" remark—the open
source community&#8217;s euphemistic version of telling someone to put up or
shut up. Instead, try getting him to take an interest in formally
testing the software and pointing out regressions. It allows him to
keep complaining, but in a useful way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="dont_feed_the_energy_creature">Don&#8217;t Feed the Energy Creature</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an old adage from Usenet.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_44" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_44" title="View footnote.">44</a>]</sup> In particular, this works best against deliberate
trolls—people who are purposely trying to get a rise out of you or
your team. The more you respond, the more the troll feeds off your
energy, and the more time you&#8217;ve wasted. The simple silent treatment
often works best. Regardless of how much you&#8217;re dying to deliver that
one-line zinger that&#8217;ll put him in his place, resist the urge. When
the person realizes nobody&#8217;s paying attention, he typically loses
interest and just leaves. Note that it often takes quite a bit of
willpower to not respond. Stay strong!</p>

<h4 id="dont_get_overly_emotional">Don&#8217;t Get Overly Emotional</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if the person isn&#8217;t deliberately trolling, it&#8217;s all too easy to
get defensive. When somebody accuses you of making a bad design
decision or of conspiracy, or simply wastes your time by asking too
many questions whose answers are obvious, it&#8217;s easy to get
upset. Remember that your job is to build great things, not to appease
every visitor or repeatedly justify your existence. The stronger your
emotions are, the more likely you are to waste hours or days writing
passionate replies to someone who doesn&#8217;t deserve such
attention. Choose your battles carefully and keep calm. Carefully decide who&#8217;s worth
replying to, and who you&#8217;ll <span class="keep-together">let be</span>.</p>

<h4 id="look_for_facts_in_the_bile">Look for Facts in the Bile</h4>

<p>Continuing on with the theme of staying clear of too much emotion, a
corollary is to actively look for facts. If someone is complaining,
listen carefully. Always start by giving the person the benefit of the
doubt, despite the angry or rude language. Does the person have a real
point? Is there something to learn from the person&#8217;s experience, or is
there an idea worth responding to? Very often the answer is "yes"—that
despite a poisonous person&#8217;s vitriolic prose, some wisdom really is
buried in there. Always bring the argument back to a technical
<span class="keep-together">discussion</span>.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_45" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_45" title="View footnote.">45</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Our favorite example of this is the day we got a rancorous email from
a well-known leader of the open source community. It was a bug report
of sorts, but on the surface it was more like a rant about the team&#8217;s
overall intelligence. The post was chock-full of slander and
hyperbole, and seemed intended to inflame the team rather than to get
the bug fixed. One of our team members, however, responded to the
report with just a few specific questions, focusing only on the
bug. The bug reporter replied with more clarification, but still it
was wrapped in over-the-top venom. Our team member continued to
completely ignore the insults, investigated the issue, and replied
with a simple "Thanks for the bug report, I see how to fix the
problem—we&#8217;ll release a patch soon."</p>

<p>We were immensely proud of the way our team member handled the

<p>Sometimes no matter how hard you try, you simply need to flip the bozo

<p>Let&#8217;s return to our story about Charlie, the friendly philosopher who
was posting far too often to the Subversion email list. Eventually we
did an analysis of the email discussions and discovered that this
participant had grown into the third most frequent poster over the
course of two months; the first and second most frequent posters were
core project contributors, and 70% of their posts were spent
<em>replying to Charlie</em>! Clearly our energy and focus were being
sucked away, despite no ill will from Charlie himself. Our final
solution was to privately email him and (politely) ask him to stop
posting so often. It was a difficult conversation to have, mainly
because he was unable to see the amount of disruption he was
causing. After a few more weeks without a significant behavioral
change, one of us actually had a long (and even more difficult)
discussion with him over the phone where we asked him to stop posting
altogether. He ultimately withdrew as requested, a bit sad and
confused, but respectful of the team&#8217;s wishes. Everyone felt a little
guilty about it because he never quite understood the harm he was
causing, but everyone also felt it was the right thing to do. It was a
delicate situation to resolve, but we used a great deal of HRT to keep
things civil and appropriate.</p>

<h4 id="focus_on_the_long_term">Focus on the Long Term</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The path to a successful project is lined by thousands of
distractions. If there&#8217;s a common theme in dealing with the
distraction of poisonous people, it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s all too easy to get
caught up in the immediate drama of a situation. If you&#8217;re witnessing
what you think may be poisonous behavior, you need to ask yourself two
critical questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Despite the short-term loss of your team&#8217;s attention and focus, <em>do
you truly believe the project will still benefit in the long run</em>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you believe the conflict will ultimately resolve itself in a useful way?</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your answer to either of these questions is "no," you need to
intervene to stop the behavior as soon as possible. It&#8217;s easy to
persuade ourselves that the short-term gain of tolerating poison is
worth it, but it usually isn&#8217;t: for example, somebody may be a great
technical contributor but still exhibit poisonous behavior. There&#8217;s a
temptation to turn a blind eye to the behavior in order to benefit
from the technical advancement. But be careful! A strong culture based
on HRT is irreplaceable, while technical contributions are
<em>definitely</em> replaceable. To quote a former teammate of ours:</p>

<p>We once encountered this sort of situation in the Subversion
project. The team has a strict policy of not putting names into source
code files (the very policy we discussed in
<a href="#building_an_awesome_team_culture">Building an Awesome Team Culture</a>!): we feel it creates
unmanageable territoriality. People are afraid to change code if it
has somebody else&#8217;s name on it, and it keeps the bus factor
artificially low. Instead, we allow the version control&#8217;s history to
credit people appropriately, and we keep a single top-level file with
all the contributors' names in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One day a smart programmer showed up and volunteered to write a
sizable new feature that was sorely needed. He submitted the code for
review, and our main feedback was simply requesting that he remove his
name from the top of the file—that we&#8217;d credit him in the same places
as everyone else. He refused to do this, however, and the debate led
to an impasse. In the end, the decision was made to reject his code
and he left, taking his toys with him. Of course everyone was
disappointed, but we didn&#8217;t want to violate our policy (and dilute our
culture) just to get the new feature sooner. A couple of months later,
someone else ended up reimplementing the feature anyway.</p>

cultivate condescension and lock out the less enlightened peasants
from your project; rather, your job is to be intolerant of destructive

<p><em>Pursue extra responsibility</em> as you&#8217;re getting your work done. One
of our favorite metaphors for this is the forest ranger who sends you,
a junior ranger, into the forest to cut down a sick or damaged
tree. If you&#8217;re focused merely on the task at hand, you&#8217;ll go into the
forest, cut down the sick tree, and return triumphant. If, however,
you&#8217;re thinking about the bigger picture, you&#8217;ll go into the forest,
cut down the sick tree, and return with a map of all the other sick
trees you encountered on your journey, along with a plan for
efficiently cutting them down if the senior ranger agrees that this is
the best plan of action. As a result of this kind of action, the next
time the forest ranger has a task that requires that level of
responsibility she&#8217;ll likely give you the first shot at it. She&#8217;ll do
this not only because she knows you can do it, but because that&#8217;s the
path of least resistance—it&#8217;s less work for her.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of proactive, responsibility-seeking behavior reduces your
manager&#8217;s workload because she has one less thing to worry about, and
it shows that you&#8217;re capable of doing work beyond your current
level. This also means you&#8217;ll likely have to leave your comfort zone
and try new things, and that&#8217;s OK if you&#8217;re on a team where you&#8217;re
encouraged to take risks and fail fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Take risks</em> and don&#8217;t fear failure. We talked a lot in Chapters
<a href="#every_boat_needs_a_captain">3</a> and <a href="#dealing_with_poisonous_people">4</a>
about the importance of taking risks
and failing fast. In the presence of an enlightened manager, failing
is a great way to learn quickly, discover the limits of what you can
and can&#8217;t do, and grow those limits over time. Our friend Steve
Hayman, who travels a lot for work, has often
said, "If you don&#8217;t miss at least one flight a year, you&#8217;re getting to
the airport too early." This is a great metaphor for creating any sort of product: if you
don&#8217;t fail at least once a year, you&#8217;re not taking enough risks. And
like the pursuit of extra responsibility, taking risks is a way to
show you&#8217;re capable of bigger things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t take risks in your work, you&#8217;ll have fewer failures, but
you&#8217;ll have fewer big successes as well. A good manager wants a team
that&#8217;s willing to push the envelope to see what they can and can&#8217;t do
(and to learn a lot in the process), and she&#8217;ll provide a soft landing
for when you fail. When you fail, take responsibility, don&#8217;t seek to
assign blame, and document what happened and what you can do to avoid
that same failure again. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Act like an adult</em>. Another recommendation in a long line of
suggestions that seem glaringly obvious: you are responsible for
teaching people how to act and how to treat you. Bad managers will frequently
train their teams to act like children by squashing any initiative,
responsibility, or rule breaking. If you&#8217;ve had one of these managers,
you often come to expect this sort of treatment from all managers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Question things</em> that you&#8217;re unsure about. If your manager makes a
decision that you disagree with, don&#8217;t be afraid to argue with her or
question the premise upon which she made the decision. While this
isn&#8217;t a license to be an obstacle, being a "yes-man" isn&#8217;t helpful to
someone in a leadership position if you&#8217;ve got information or
experience that she lacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Your manager is not clairvoyant</em>: only rarely will you find a
person in an organization who <em>over</em>communicates, so don&#8217;t hesitate
to update your team&#8217;s leader on what you&#8217;re doing before she asks you
what&#8217;s going on. Drop her a quick note when you hit an obstacle, score
a victory, need something, or expect something. Not only is this a
great way to make sure your manager knows what you&#8217;re up to, but we&#8217;ve
seen crafty engineers take this technique to the extreme as a way to
deal with micromanagement: if your manager keeps checking in on you,
proactively sending her an email at the same frequency with which she
checks in on you is a surefire way to get her to back off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These techniques work well when you&#8217;re in the ideal organization, but
what about when your organization is anything but ideal?</p>

<h4 id="your_life_under_a_bad_manager">The Bad Manager</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know where to start in describing the traits of a bad
manager—entire movies and TV shows have been created solely to lampoon
the bad managers of the world. Most of us have had at least one bad
manager in our careers, and a bad manager can make life on even the greatest
team a living hell, so we&#8217;re going to cover just a few of the traits
of a bad manager that typically affect <span class="keep-together">engineers</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fear of failure is one of the most common
traits of bad managers. This insecurity tends to make them very
conservative, which is antithetical to the work style of the typical
engineer. If your manager doesn&#8217;t want you to take risks, there is
little opportunity for you to inject your own ideas into your product
and you&#8217;ll usually wind up implementing (by rote) the product
someone else designed.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_47" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_47" title="View footnote.">47</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oftentimes the insecure manager will insist on inserting herself into
any interaction you have with people outside your team, thereby
preventing you from speaking directly to other teams without "going
through the chain of command." This kind of manager will consider any
direct contact you make with anyone outside your team—especially
another manager—to be akin to mutiny or insubordination. If you need
anything outside your team or their organization, this manager expects
you to go through her, which allows her to elevate her importance and
subordinate you, thus giving her more power.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of us grew up in school hearing the oft-repeated canard
"knowledge is power." The bad manager is
very much aware of this, but from a different angle: she wants to keep
this power to herself and not share it with you, no matter how much it
might help you to do your job. This manager hoards information and hides it from you as a way to make sure
she can play a part in anything that involves that information, which
not only keeps you from getting work done, but also helps her maintain
her position of relevance and power no matter how much it slows down
development.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id032" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_05in04.png" alt="dbtm 05in04">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By hoarding information and requiring that they be a conduit for
information and communication, bad managers are also able to take credit for your
successes<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_48" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_48" title="View footnote.">48</a>]</sup> and
blame you for your failures (and sometimes, their failures as
well). In many cases, this kind of bad manager sees your existence
solely as a means to get herself promoted, and she doesn&#8217;t care about
your career, much less your team&#8217;s happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our friend Susan had a terrible manager for a number of years, and her
manager would often hand a new project off to Susan with no context,
no information on how to get the project done, and no one to contact
with questions. He would do this even if Susan had zero knowledge or
context about the new task, because this forced her to rely on him for
information as well as communication with other teams. Susan&#8217;s manager
didn&#8217;t necessarily want Susan to fail: in fact, if he&#8217;d told Susan
everything she needed to know about the project, it would have made
Susan&#8217;s life
easier and more productive. On the other hand, he was most likely
afraid that it would have been that much easier for her to circumvent him!
Having the ability to directly contact relevant teams would have made
them aware that Susan, and not her manager, was working on this
project. Time and time again Susan would scramble to get up to speed
on the new project, get it done, and then collapse, only to find out
through the grapevine that her manager had taken credit for her work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In stark contrast to the servant leader we
discussed in <a href="#every_boat_needs_a_captain">Every Boat Needs a Captain</a>, the bad manager wants to
know what you&#8217;ve done for him lately. And those low performers on your
team?  They&#8217;re not going anywhere as long as they don&#8217;t grind your
team to a screeching halt—it&#8217;s too much work for the bad manager to
deal with them.  It boils down to this: is your manager serving you?
Or are you serving your manager? It should <em>always</em> be the former.</p>

<h4 id="the_office_politician">The Office Politician</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we&#8217;re big proponents of trusting people, or at the very least
giving them the benefit of the doubt, trusting the office politician can be a seriously
career-limiting move.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The office politician may be difficult to spot when you first meet him
because he tends to be very good at managing relationships and dealing
with people—he may be quite friendly at first. He usually does an
exceptional job of managing up and an even better job of using his
peers and subordinates as a means for
self-promotion. He&#8217;s quick to blame others, but
even quicker to steal credit when given the opportunity. He&#8217;s usually
not directly confrontational, but instead prefers to tell you what you
want to hear so that you&#8217;ll think well of him. If he can&#8217;t use you or
manipulate you, he&#8217;ll either ignore you or, if he sees you as a
threat, try to undermine you. After you&#8217;ve worked with him for a
while, it&#8217;s easy to spot him: he spends more time <em>looking</em>
impactful than actually <em>being</em> impactful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We advise that you steer clear of the office
politician: route around him where possible, but don&#8217;t carelessly
badmouth him to other people above him in the organization, because
it&#8217;s quite difficult to know who he has hoodwinked and who is wise to
him. If you&#8217;re the kind of person who is happy to keep your head down
and focus on building interesting technology, you may want to rethink
this strategy when there&#8217;s an office politician around. If you don&#8217;t put energy
into getting promoted because you don&#8217;t want to "play the game," you
may find that the office politician gets promoted over you, in which
case you&#8217;ve now got a bad
manager <em>and</em> an office politician. See

succeeding. As with bad managers, much has been written about
bad organizations, so
we&#8217;re only going to review a few examples of organizational issues
that most often affect individual contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s a simple fact that most companies are not
engineering-focused. That is to say: engineers are a means to
accomplish business goals that are typically not technical. This means
the people running the company probably don&#8217;t understand the technical
underpinnings of their system, just the demands set upon them by the
business, and so they wind up creating unrealistic demands on
engineering. Even if a technically competent executive finds her way
into this sort of company and fights to defend her organization,
she&#8217;ll frequently find herself replaced by someone who is willing to
sacrifice the health and sanity of the employees to meet the needs of
the business. Typically you&#8217;ll see this directly in the form of
unrealistic deadlines and lack of qualified technical people to get
projects completed on time. You may have difficulty acquiring enough
hardware to effectively run your product, or find your team spending
weeks rewriting something when a hardware purchase costing only a few
hundred dollars would have done the job. This is unfortunately typical
of a company that doesn&#8217;t value engineers and treats them like "work
units" or "resources," giving them no voice in how the company
operates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most egregiously bad organizations have ossified command and control
structures that resemble fiefdoms. Years ago, our friend Terrence
worked at a company that had strict rules on passing bugs between
teams, and eventually another team created a bug that caused
Terrence&#8217;s product to run out of memory over the course of a few
hours. Instead of emailing the team members who were responsible for
this, or looking at their commit logs or source code, he stayed up all
night reproducing the bug, gathering data, and building his
case. Terrence sent this email to his manager, who sent the email to
his director, who emailed the director of the team that created the
bug. This director emailed that team&#8217;s manager, who figured out who on
his team was responsible for the software in question. More than 10
days later, Terrence found himself in a meeting with two managers, two
directors, and three other engineers discussing the bug and whether
they could get it fixed in time for their next launch. Sound absurd?
Sadly, this sort of thing happens all the time. In contrast, during
Fitz&#8217;s first week at Google he found a typo in Gmail. He opened the
source code, fixed the typo, then emailed a patch to the Gmail team,
who thanked him heartily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many companies are filled with people who are obsessed with
organizational hierarchy.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_49" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_49" title="View footnote.">49</a>]</sup> This results in
endless power struggles, with managers often preventing engineers from
transferring to another team in order to protect their own team from
losing a valuable contributor—even when the right thing to do for both
the company and the engineer is to let the transfer happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Has your company ever treated you like a naughty child? Are you unable
to get to innocuous external websites due to an overzealous company
firewall? Do you have to carefully account for every moment of your
day with a detailed timecard? Some organizations will even go so far as to
measure your productivity by meaningless (and usually wildly
inaccurate) methods such as the number of lines of code you write
every week.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_50" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_50" title="View footnote.">50</a>]</sup></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Still other organizations will breed employees who judge their success
not by the number and quality of products they ship, but by the number
of meetings they&#8217;re invited to attend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, your company might lack important things like focus, vision,
or direction. This is often the result of too many masters, or "design
by committee," which results in conflicting
orders being sent down to the rank and file. So you wind up moving in
ever-tighter circles instead of in a coherent direction.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many bad companies are guilty of
these transgressions, and much, much more. Still, these companies are
composed of people, and there are a number of tips and tricks you can
put to bear to get people to help you out.</p>

<p>Much like the sparring program, companies are made of rules: some of
them can be bent, and others can be broken. If you focus on the way
things <em>should</em> be in your organization, you&#8217;ll usually find nothing
but frustration and disappointment. Instead, acknowledge the way
things <em>are</em>, and focus on navigating your organization&#8217;s structure
to find the mechanisms you can use to get things done and to carve out
a happy place for yourself in your company. Whether you&#8217;re in a good
organization or a bad one, there are a number of strategies that we&#8217;ve
found to be quite effective at getting things done.</p>

<h4 id="its_easier_to_ask_for_forgiveness_than_p">"It&#8217;s Easier to Ask for Forgiveness Than Permission"<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_51" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_51" title="View footnote.">51</a>]</sup></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First and foremost, know what you can get away with in your
organization—while asking for permission does give you an opportunity
to push responsibility onto someone else, it also creates an
opportunity for someone to tell you "no." It&#8217;s important to know what
you can get away with in your organization without explicitly getting
approval from one of your superiors, but wherever possible, we advise
you to do what you think is right for the company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you&#8217;re prepared to beg for forgiveness, choose your battles
wisely—every time you have to plead your case for something or go up
against someone else in your company, you&#8217;re spending your political
capital. If you spend all your capital winning a bunch of battles that
just don&#8217;t matter, you&#8217;re going to find that you have nothing left in
your account when it comes to the important things. Be strategic and
fight for things either that matter or that you&#8217;re pretty sure you
have <em>some</em> chance of winning. Blowing all your capital on a battle
you know you can&#8217;t win is pointless, stressful, and career limiting
for no good reason.  For more details, see <a href="#your_political_bank_account">Your Political Bank Account</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do decide to go the "beg for forgiveness" route, it&#8217;s useful to
have colleagues and friends in your company that you can use as a
sounding board for your ideas—especially your riskier ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These people should have a good sense of what you can and can&#8217;t get
away with in the company as well as which ideas just won&#8217;t fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When someone in marketing suggested that Fitz raise awareness of his
Data Liberation team among the executives at Google, Fitz bounced an
idea off his sounding-board colleagues: give Data Liberation–branded
bolt cutters and locked boxes of swag (with the keys locked inside, of
course) to the execs. He decided to go ahead with it and it was a big
hit. A few years later, when Fitz was contemplating printing up some,
shall we say, "off-color" swag, the same sounding board expressed some
concern that the plan was too risky and Fitz decided to nix that
plan. If you&#8217;re going to act without asking permission, it&#8217;s good to trust your instincts,
but a second opinion from a trusted source is
invaluable.</p>

<p>Another strategy for making change in a company is to find ways to get
your ideas accepted at a grassroots level. If you can get enough
people to buy into your idea or use a particular product, it will
often be too late for the bureaucracy to squash you, and management
will be forced to notice and either accept it or act against it (which
costs them, yep, you guessed it, political capital!). This is a
strategy that many engineers used for years, for example, to sneak
open source tools into their daily workflow in order to make their
lives a lot more pleasant.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re trying to persuade someone, a great way to increase your
chances of success is to find several people who agree with you and
get <em>them</em> to drop your idea (or proposal or request) in a
conversation with that person. Even if your target is totally aware of
what&#8217;s going on, basic human psychology dictates that she&#8217;ll give more
weight to the idea because it&#8217;s hitting her from multiple directions

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideas in particular are fascinating things: they can go a long way if
you don&#8217;t care who gets the credit! Sometimes you&#8217;ll find that people
will spread an idea only if they can take credit for the idea as their
own, so you need to decide what&#8217;s more important: that you get the
credit, or that the idea spreads. Despite the fact that it may pain
you to hear your words coming out of another (perhaps despised)
person&#8217;s mouth, it&#8217;s often the most effortless way for an idea to
travel. We&#8217;ve seen this happen time and time again in companies large
and small: the lofty concepts and ideas coming from an executive&#8217;s
mouth originate from someone in her organization. Think about the
broad audience that your idea—which would otherwise go unheard—can
reach in this case!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as with individuals, eliminating bad habits in a company is
difficult. One of Ben&#8217;s early teachers used to have a saying: "It&#8217;s
impossible to simply stop a bad habit; you need to <em>replace</em> it with
a good habit." Anyone who&#8217;s ever tried to quit smoking is intimately
familiar with this phenomenon. Corporations are the same way—if you&#8217;re
going to successfully eliminate a bad habit, find a better one to
replace it. Don&#8217;t like a certain weekly meeting? Replace it with a
different kind of meeting or alternate (more effective) ritual. Don&#8217;t
like a useless reporting process? Don&#8217;t complain about it; write a
useful one that&#8217;s too compelling to ignore. Once you&#8217;ve found a good
replacement habit, you need to overcome the inertia of change
aversion, so we recommend offering to "try" your new ritual for a few
weeks. This makes the new thing seem less permanent, less scary, and
if it turns out that everyone likes the new ritual, by the time your
"trial" period is over, they&#8217;ve forgotten that it was a trial in the
first place.</p>

<h4 id="learn_to_manage_upward">Learn to Manage Upward</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a manager or an individual contributor, you need to
spend some of your time managing
upward. By this we mean you need to try to ensure that both your
manager and the people outside your team are not only aware of what
you&#8217;re doing, but are aware that you&#8217;re doing it well. Some people
find this mode of "selling yourself" distasteful, and it may remain
so, but the benefits of doing this are huge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ll mention in <a href="#usersare_people_too">Users Are People, Too</a>, you need to underpromise
and overdeliver whenever possible. We&#8217;re not advocating that you
sandbag all your estimates and pad out your deadlines, but wherever
you can, try to avoid promising things that you can&#8217;t deliver, even if
it means saying "no" more often than you&#8217;d like. If you constantly
miss deadlines or drop features, other people in the company will have
less of a reason to trust you and will most likely pass over you when
they&#8217;re looking for someone to get something done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We recommend that you focus your energies on <em>launching products</em>
over just about everything else. Shipping things gives you
credibility, reputation, and political capital more than just about
anything else in a company. Launching your product is a high-visibility event that shows you&#8217;re
accomplishing something. As tempting as it might be to spend a ton of
time cleaning up your code base and refactoring things, we&#8217;ve learned
from experience that if you dedicate more than half of your time to
this kind of defensive work, it&#8217;s hardly valued at all by anyone
outside of your team, including your superiors. You will then find
yourself in the somewhat embarrassing position of having almost
nothing (politically) important to show for your
time.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_52" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_52" title="View footnote.">52</a>]</sup>

<div class="title">"Offensive" Versus "Defensive" Work</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Ben first became a manager, it seemed like his team&#8217;s
productivity was being crushed under a mountain of accrued
technical debt. He decided that the team&#8217;s top
priority was to spend a long time doing nothing but paying back this
debt. His superiors gave a cursory nod to this plan and the work
began. Things didn&#8217;t go well. Despite the prior approval, Ben&#8217;s
manager began to get annoyed and impatient after a few months—why was
the team getting "nothing done"? Ben&#8217;s team was actually quite
productive and he tried to show the enormous amount of debt that had
been paid back. But it turns out there&#8217;s just no way this sort of work
can impress someone; at an emotional level it&#8217;s just fundamentally
boring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this bad experience, Ben began to categorize all work as either
"offensive" or "defensive." <em>Offensive</em> work is typically effort
toward new user-visible features—shiny things that are easy to show
outsiders and get them excited about, or things that noticeably
advance the appeal of a product (e.g., improved UI, faster response
times). <em>Defensive</em> work is effort aimed at the long-term health of a
product (e.g., code refactoring, feature rewrites, schema changes,
data migration, or improved emergency monitoring). Defensive
activities make the product more maintainable, stable, and
reliable. And yet, despite the fact that they&#8217;re absolutely critical,
you <em>get no political credit</em> for doing them. If you spend all your
time on them, people perceive your product as holding still. And to
make wordplay on an old maxim: "Perception is nine-tenths of the
law."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now have a handy rule we live by: a team should never spend more
than one-third to one-half of its time and energy on defensive work, no matter how much technical debt there
is. Any more time spent is a recipe for political suicide.</p>

<p>Regardless of the kind of company you work in, believe it or not, it&#8217;s
not that hard to create a sort of luck for yourself. Richard
Wiseman, author of <em>The Luck Factor</em>,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_53" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_53" title="View footnote.">53</a>]</sup> wrote about an

<p>I gave both lucky and unlucky people a newspaper, and asked them to

average, the unlucky people took about two minutes to count the
photographs, whereas the lucky people took just seconds. Why? Because
the second page of the newspaper contained the message: "Stop
counting. There are 43 photographs in this newspaper." This message
took up half of the page and was written in type that was more than
2in high. It was staring everyone straight in the face, but the
unlucky people tended to miss it and the lucky people tended to spot
it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>He then goes on to note that lucky people "are skilled at creating and
noticing chance opportunities." We think the same tenet
applies to creating opportunities in companies: if you perform your
job to the letter of the law and focus only on getting your own work
done to the exclusion of all else, there will be few chance
opportunities for you. If you help others get their jobs done when
given the chance, even when it&#8217;s not part of your job, there&#8217;s no
guarantee (nor should there be a "tit for tat" expectation) that
they&#8217;ll return the favor, but many people will gladly repay the favor

<h4 id="your_political_bank_account">Your Political Bank Account</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every company has a gray-market favor economy that lives outside the
org chart, and those favors are one of the main things that you can
use to fill up your political bank account. There&#8217;s usually something
you can quickly and easily do that benefits your company but is
someone else&#8217;s job, and if you keep your eyes open for the chance to
do these things (in many cases, someone will come right out and ask
you to do something for them), you earn a bit of credit for your bank
account in this favor economy. Think of these credits as a series of
small bets: some will never pay you back, others will pay even money,
and still others will pay <em>enormous</em> dividends. It&#8217;s hard to know
which bets will pay off, but one thing that will pay off over time is
that people will remember you as the person who helped them out in a
jam. Later on, when you&#8217;re in a jam and you give them a call, they&#8217;re
going to be considerably more likely—even eager—to help you out than
if you gave them a big fat "not my job" response when they came
looking for help. Even if you never get "paid back" you&#8217;ll often learn
something new in the process of helping someone, and it feels good to
help other people, so what do you have to lose other than a little
time and effort?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>This same political bank account is what you&#8217;ll tap when you need to
ask a favor of someone else in the company. It may be that you need
someone to do something for you, or you do something that steps on
someone else&#8217;s toes, or you even just disagree with someone else in
your company. It&#8217;s incredibly useful to develop an awareness of when
you&#8217;re gaining political capital, and when you&#8217;re spending it. If you
fail to develop this awareness, there&#8217;s a good chance that your
account will be drained before you know it, leaving you powerless in
your organization (and your career).</p>

To: sjobs@apple.com

Subject: Terrible customer experience with our hardware—what can I do?

I would deeply appreciate if you could advise me on what I can do to
address this problem. This is embarrassing—both for Apple and for
myself.

I purchased an iMac for my mother last Mother's Day—she is the
Vice-Principal of a Montessori school in New Orleans and uses an old
Macintosh at school. She was very excited to get the iMac, and has
even gotten funds for her school to buy iMacs for their lab.

However, the strawberry iMac I bought for her has turned out to be a
total lemon.

- In July, it went to sleep and never woke up. She brought it to an
  Authorized Apple Dealer and they diagnosed the problem as a failed
  logic board and replaced it.

- She brought it home, plugged it in, it started to boot, then she got
  a sad mac and the tones of death. She brought it back to the
  dealer. They diagnosed the problem as a faulty analog board and
  replaced it.

- In September, I finally convinced her to use the sleep function
  again (in lieu of shutdown/boot). The iMac wouldn't wake
  up. Completely unplugging the computer and plugging it back in
  eventually got it to boot again. We have disabled sleep altogether
  at this point.

- In December, the monitor started flickering colors from yellow to
  green to blue. She brought it back to the dealer yesterday, and
  that's where it is now.

So that's where I am today. My mother thinks I've pulled some sort of
sick prank on her, is telling everyone she knows that her iMac is
junk, and no one I know that works at Apple knows what to do about it.

Is there anything that I can do to get her a working iMac (short of
purchasing another one)?

Respectfully,

-Fitz</pre>

right thing—even busy executives (many of them enjoy righting a wrong,
and absolutely all of them understand the value of gaining a little
extra political capital). Unfortunately, the email inbox of these
people looks like a never-ending distributed-denial-of-service attack,
and if they encounter an email from someone they&#8217;ve never met before
that is 3,000 words of solid text with no paragraph breaks, the odds
are good that they&#8217;re going to read 15 words in, press the Delete key,
and then move on to the next email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, however, they can fix something by reading an email in 10 seconds
and waving a magic wand (i.e., mailing one of their minions to Make It
Happen), they&#8217;ll likely do it. They spend a few seconds delegating and
get a big pile of political capital from you in return.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After years of trial and error, we&#8217;ve found that shorter emails are
even more likely to get a response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We call this the "Three Bullets and a Call to Action" technique, and it will drastically increase your chances of
getting action—or at the very least, a response—from just about anyone
you email out of the blue asking for something,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_58" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_58" title="View footnote.">58</a>]</sup> not just an
executive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good Three
Bullets and a Call to Action email contains (at <em>most</em>) three bullet
points detailing the issue at hand, and one—<em>and only one</em>—call to
action. That&#8217;s it, nothing more—you need to write an email that can
be easily forwarded along. If you ramble or put four completely
different things in the email, you can be certain that they&#8217;ll pick
only one thing to respond to, and it will be the item that you care
least about. Or worse, the mental overhead is high enough that your
mail will get dropped entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bullet points should be short sentences (each one should fit on
a single line without wrapping), and the call to action should be as
short as possible. If you want a reply from <em>anyone</em>, make it easier
for the person to reply inline, preferably with a one (or two) word
answer. Don&#8217;t ask half a dozen questions in one paragraph—limit
yourself to a single question per paragraph, or ideally, a single
question per email. Lastly, your email should be loaded with HRT:
polite, respectful, and devoid of grammar mistakes and spelling
errors. If you positively cannot help yourself and simply must include
more background or information, put it at the very end of your email
(even after your signature), and label it clearly as "More details" or
"Background."</p>

Subject: Bad customer experience—can you help?

- I purchased an iMac for my mother, a school administrator. She was
  very excited to get the iMac and has even gotten funds for her
  school to buy more iMacs for their lab.

- In July, Apple replaced a faulty logic board, and a month later, the
  analog board.

- In September it stopped sleeping correctly, and in December the
  monitor started to fail. It's currently at the dealer.

My mother is telling everyone she knows that her iMac is junk, and no
one I know that works at Apple knows what to do about it.

Is there anything that I can do to get her a working iMac?

Respectfully,

<p>In the course of our careers, we&#8217;ve used all of these techniques over

<h3 id="plan_b_get_out">Plan B: Get Out</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all the years that we&#8217;ve spoken about getting things done inside
bad organizations and working with bad people, we always get people
who come up to us after our talks and, exasperated, tell us they&#8217;ve
tried <em>everything</em> and just can&#8217;t make any improvements or get
anything done, so what can they do? The unfortunate answer here is a
simple one: there&#8217;s probably nothing else you <em>can</em> do. Don&#8217;t be a
victim. Get the heck out of there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can&#8217;t change the system, there&#8217;s no point in continuing to put
energy into changing it. Instead, put energy into leaving it: update your résumé,
and start asking your close friends if they know of any openings for
you at other companies. Train yourself in new things. One of the great
things about being a knowledge worker in this day and age is that good
ones are in high demand, and that gives you the ability to control
your own future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you realize you have this control, it&#8217;s incredibly liberating. If
you poke around and discover that you have other job options available
to you, you may discover that you suddenly get a lot more things done

Subject: Thank you note
From: Alex Mrvaljevich
To: Brian Fitzpatrick

Hello Brian!

You probably don't remember me, but you gave me the best two pieces of
career advice i have ever gotten, and changed my life.

I attended your tech talk @ Google IO 2010 and approached you after the
talk to ask about advice on my current work situation. Quite simply you
told me to "get the hell out" so i sent you my CV as Project Manager; After
this you let me know that google RARELY hires non-technical project
managers.

Because of that i had to think long and hard about my career: Whatever
Google's policy is, majority of companies follow suit.

Changing career tracks was my only option, my closest bet was Product
Management. Studied my ass off and "got the hell out" not only of the
company I was in, but also of the country (There aren't a lot of
Product Management jobs in Venezuela), it ended up being the best move
in my life...

Now because of that move I just landed an amazing job as Product Lead in
Japan, and am moving to Kobe in February.

I promised myself if things ever turned around because of that piece of
advice I would send you a thank you note, so here it is:

Thank you.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All this talk about quitting or waiting to get fired doesn&#8217;t mean that
if you&#8217;re unhappy in your job you should dust off your résumé and hit
the streets. On the contrary, your first objective should be to make
the changes necessary to be happy and accomplish your goals at your
job, and this chapter has given you a lot of the tools you&#8217;ll need to
do that. If you don&#8217;t put the effort into understanding how to
navigate your organization, you&#8217;re leaving a huge part of your destiny to chance.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="usersare_people_too">Users Are People, Too</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve explored a long list of ingredients that are critical to
successful product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start with a small group of smart, creative people. Fertilize the team
with a strong culture of humility, trust, and respect. Lead them as a
servant, empowering them to collaborate and make good decisions. Give
them water, sunlight, direction, and intrinsic motivation as
needed. Protect them from negative influences—destructive behaviors
(or environments) that threaten the culture and the ability to make
progress. Bake at 72°F for six months, and you&#8217;ve got some great
software. All done, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of programmers stop there. They write software for themselves,
are pleased with the end result, and then declare victory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not how the real world works. "Good software" is
an overly narrow definition of success. If you&#8217;re trying to pay the
bills (or simply boost your résumé) you also need a lot of other
people to use your software and be happy with it. The software
development process doesn&#8217;t end with throwing a product over a wall;
it never ends, in fact. People use your product and you need to react
to them, improving it over time. If you don&#8217;t learn how to master this
feedback loop your creation will die.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll examine three general phases of user engagement in this
chapter. First you need to get users to notice your work—are they even
aware that it exists? How do they perceive it before they walk in the
door? Then you&#8217;ll need to think about what people experience when they
start using it. Does it meet their expectations? Is it usable? Does it
empower them to do great things? Finally, we&#8217;ll look at how to
interact productively with them once they&#8217;re firmly engaged with your
creation. All of these interactions are part of the cyclical nature of
product <span class="keep-together">development</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bottom line is this: collaboration isn&#8217;t just about working with
your team; to make great things, you need to actively collaborate with
your <em>users</em> too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re not on top of these things, all you&#8217;ll have is a piece of
shiny software with no users. If that&#8217;s the case, maybe it&#8217;s time to
question your career choice!</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="managing_public_perception">Managing Public Perception</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you hear the term <em>marketing</em>, what&#8217;s the first thing that
comes to mind?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re like most folks, the word probably conjures up the image of
a dishonest salesperson, all fake smile and greased-back hair:
somebody who&#8217;s all about building an image for a client or product. If
your product is the raw "meat" to be sold, the marketing person&#8217;s job
is to add the magic "sizzle" to the steak so that more people flock to
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why does this idea bug us so much? Why do we shudder at the thought of
the marketing person?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because, as programmers, the marketer represents the antithesis of
engineering culture. We&#8217;re obsessed with truth. Either the code
compiles or it doesn&#8217;t; the software has a feature or it doesn&#8217;t; it
solves a problem or it doesn&#8217;t. We don&#8217;t "spin" our descriptions of
the world; we state the facts and then work to change them. We look at
the marketing guy and all we see are lies, and we don&#8217;t like being
lied to. We want order, predictability, and accurate statements when
it comes to making decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because we perceive marketing as something that distorts the truth, it
violates the maker&#8217;s instinctive desire for meritocracy. We believe
the best product should always win. And by "best" we mean the product
that <em>objectively</em> is of the highest quality and most effective, not
the one with the slickest TV advertisements. Over and over we&#8217;re
disappointed when we see superior technologies lose out: many believe
that Betamax was superior to VHS, that Laserdisc was better than DVD,
or that Lisp is still the best programming language (we just need to
get the word out!). Even in the world of version control tools,
Subversion has taken over the corporate world despite the technical
superiority of newer systems like Git.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id037" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_06in01.png" alt="dbtm 06in01">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s worse is we perceive marketing folks as
overpromising to customers, which in turn makes engineers look like
they&#8217;re always underdelivering. It makes steam pour from our ears.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re here to give you both bad news and good news.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bad news is that no, you cannot ignore marketing. It actually
matters and you have to deal with it. The good news is that it&#8217;s
possible to actively cooperate with marketing. It doesn&#8217;t need to be a
sleazy affair when you do it right. In fact, it can be an incredibly
powerful tool to success!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programmers tend to have an overdeveloped sense of logic, but most
humans are driven equally by logic <em>and</em> emotion. The
marketing folks are masters of emotional
manipulation, and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re so effective: they mix the facts
with feelings to get attention. If you want to get new people to use
your software, you <em>have to care</em> about their emotional
perception of your software. You cannot change
the way people make decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apple Inc. is the undisputed master of making technology appeal to the
emotions of nontechnical people. Firmly dating ourselves in the year
2015, we ask: is an iPhone objectively superior to an Android phone?
Featurewise they&#8217;re almost identical. But if a nontechnical user
believes an iPhone is magical, it really <em>is</em> magical, at least to
that user. Perception is reality. Or as we&#8217;ve said earlier,
"Perception is nine-tenths of the law."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s tempting to think that the only way to win is not to play, but
this is a game you&#8217;re not allowed to ignore. You need at least a
minimal marketing strategy to even get your software in the ring, and
if you&#8217;re smart about it then you&#8217;ll discover that marketing can be a
serious force multiplier for great engineering.  Here are some basic
things you can do to take control, and they&#8217;re all based on HRT.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="pay_attention_to_first_impressions">Pay Attention to First Impressions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re hungry and searching for a restaurant, how the restaurant
appears from the street really matters. If it seems disgusting or
uninviting you simply aren&#8217;t going in. If it&#8217;s warm and friendly and
the host is kind, you&#8217;ll be willing to give it a fair chance. Don&#8217;t
underestimate the emotional impact of a well-designed first experience with your product—if you&#8217;ve
ever unboxed an iPad or a Nest thermostat, you know exactly what we
mean here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is your product like to a newbie? Is it welcoming and does it
encourage exploration? Conversely, for an expert who sits down to an
initial session with your software, does it appear familiar and
sensible? At first glance, does your app scream instant productivity,
or steep learning curve and countless tears? More specifically, what
does a user experience in the first 30 seconds after launching your
software? Don&#8217;t just give an intellectual answer ("she sees a menu of
choices, with a login box") but give an emotional answer too. How does
a new user <em>feel</em> after a minute? Empowered or just confused? What
can you do to improve that feeling? Step back a level and look at your
product&#8217;s website. Does it seem professional and inviting, like a good
storefront? You need to take these things seriously for your software
to be taken seriously.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3 pagebreak-before">
<h4 id="underpromise_and_overdeliver">Underpromise and Overdeliver</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t let your marketing people preempt you here. If users ask about
upcoming features or release timelines, take the opportunity to give
overly conservative estimates. If you let marketers spread rumors,
you&#8217;ll end up with a <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> situation—software that&#8217;s
teased for shipping <em>15 years</em> late. But if your own (more accurate)
message gets out first, your users will
always be thrilled. Google is great at this; it has a deliberate
policy of <em>not</em> preannouncing features for any product. When new
features roll out they&#8217;re often a delightful surprise. It also
prevents internal death marches to meet unrealistic advertised launch
dates. The software is released when it&#8217;s actually ready and usable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="work_with_industry_analysts_respectfully">Work with Industry Analysts Respectfully</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of programmers hate the media
industry—it&#8217;s just marketing in another guise. When a trade magazine
or research firm comes knocking on the door, a lot of companies will
drop everything and kowtow to their requests. They realize that a good
(or bad) review can make or break a product&#8217;s perception. Engineers
tend to resent this sort of power and deference, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, there was a time when members of the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF) had problems interacting with analysts. An analyst
would ask the ASF for industry-standard white papers describing their
Apache HTTPD server, and the typical snarky response might be, "Go
read the documentation on the website, like everyone else." While this
satisfied the open source developers' deep commitment to meritocracy,
overall it was counterproductive to public perception—particularly
among corporate users. Eventually the ASF "PR person" worked to
reeducate a number of community members about this attitude and deal
more productively with analysts. Passive-aggressively fighting the
system—no matter how irritating it is—just doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s no
different from telling the restaurant reviewer to get back at the end
of the line. Should the reviewer get preferential treatment?
Probably not. But is it worth sticking it to him as a matter of
principle? <em>Definitely</em> not. You&#8217;re only hurting yourself in the
process. Choose your battles carefully.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2 pagebreak-before">
<h3 id="how_usable_is_your_software">How Usable Is Your Software?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a hard truth: unless you&#8217;re developing software tools,
engineers are not the audience of your software. The corollary is that
you, as an engineer, are a terrible evaluator of your software&#8217;s
usability. An interface that seems totally reasonable to you may very
likely make your nontechie neighbor pull out her hair in
frustration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we assume that "successful software" means "lots of people use and
love your software," you need to pay deep attention to your
users. Google has a famous motto:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>It sounds fairly campy, but over our careers we&#8217;ve watched this maxim
play out over and over across multiple projects. We&#8217;ve witnessed
projects succeed and fail based on this truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of Google&#8217;s big breakthroughs was to begin measuring the
effectiveness of search ads. If users click on a particular ad, it
must be useful to them; if it never gets clicks, it must be annoying
or useless. Bad ads get removed from the system and feedback is given
to the advertiser to improve its ads. At first this seems
counterproductive for the short term: Google is actively rejecting
revenue sources. But by making the <em>searcher</em> (rather than the
advertiser) the focus of attention, it dramatically increases the
usefulness (and usage) of Google&#8217;s search advertising system over the
long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about some important ways you can focus directly on your users.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="choose_your_audience">Choose Your Audience</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First things first: imagine your users fall across a spectrum of

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you were to draw a vertical line showing <em>which set of users</em> is
best suited to your product, where would you put it? A vertical line
through the center of the bell curve means that about half of all
computer users would be happy using your product (i.e., those to the
right of the line).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>As an example, let&#8217;s take the problem of wanting to display Internet
content on your large TV screen.  How has the "usability" of competing
solutions widened potential audiences?   Initially people had to plug their laptop
computers directly into their televisions.  This involved
understanding analog versus digital inputs and having the right sort of
audio and video cables.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id040" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_06in04.png" alt="dbtm 06in04">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apple then came out with an Apple TV product&#8212;&#8203;a small computer-like
appliance that you left permanently plugged into your TV.  It could be
controlled from a computer or smartphone, and you could stream either your
private media or live Internet content.  This solved the problem for a
much larger (and less technical) audience:  it came with the proper
cables, and you plugged it in once and left it there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google then one-upped things by coming out with the Chromecast, a
small stick that plugs directly into a TV&#8217;s HDMI port.  It was even
easier to install and allowed people to "cast" their screen from a
wider array of both Apple <em>and</em> non-Apple devices.  At the time of writing,
we&#8217;re now seeing new TVs being shipped with built-in WiFi and
Internet streaming.  It&#8217;s likely that Ben&#8217;s kids will never remember a
time when TVs didn&#8217;t have Netflix built in!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point here is that good product development aims to move the
vertical line to the <em>left</em> as much as possible. In general, the
more users you have, the more successful you are (and the more money
your company makes!). The moral here is that when you&#8217;re considering
your users, think hard about who your audience is. Is your work usable by the
biggest group possible? This is why simple and thoughtful user interfaces matter so much—as well as things like
polished documentation and accessible tutorials.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id041" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_06in05.png" alt="dbtm 06in05">
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="consider_barrier_to_entry">Consider Barrier to Entry</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now think about the first-time users of your software. How hard is it
to get going for the first time? If your users can&#8217;t easily try it
out, you won&#8217;t have any. A first-time user usually isn&#8217;t thinking
about whether your software is more or less powerful than a
competitor&#8217;s; she just wants to get something
done. Quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To illustrate, take a look at popular scripting languages. A majority of programmers will
espouse that Perl or Python is a "better" language than PHP. They&#8217;ll
claim that Perl/Python/Ruby programs are easier to read and maintain
over the long run, have more mature libraries, and are inherently
safer and more secure when exposed to the open Web. Yet PHP is far
more popular—at least for web development. Why? Because any high
school student can just pick it up through osmosis by copying his
buddy&#8217;s website. There&#8217;s no need to read books, do extensive
tutorials, or learn serious programming patterns. It&#8217;s conducive to
tinkering: just start hacking on your site and figure out different
PHP tricks from your peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example can be found in text editors. Should
programmers use Emacs or vi? Does it matter? Not really, but why would
a person choose one over the other? Here&#8217;s a true anecdote: when Ben
first started learning Unix (during an
internship in 1990) he was looking for a text editor to launch. He
opened an existing file by launching vi for the first time, and was
utterly frustrated within 20 seconds—he could move around within the
file, but couldn&#8217;t type anything! Of course, vi users know that one
has to enter "edit" mode to change the file, but it was still a
horrible first experience for a newbie. When Ben launched Emacs
instead, he could immediately begin editing a file just like he would
do on his familiar home word processor. Because the initial behavior
of Emacs was identical to his previous experiences, Ben decided to
become an Emacs user within his first
minute. It&#8217;s a silly reason to choose one product over another, but
this sort of thing happens all the time! That first minute with a
product is <em>critical</em>.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_60" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_60" title="View footnote.">60</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, there are other ways to destroy the first impression. The
first time your software runs, don&#8217;t present the user with a giant form
to fill out or a giant panel of mandatory preferences to set. Forcing
the user to create some sort of new account is pretty off-putting as
well; it implies long-term commitment before the user has even done
anything. Another personal pet peeve is a website instantly blasting a
visitor with a modal "Subscribe to us!" dialog box within the first
two seconds.  All these things send the user screaming in the other
direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A great example of a nearly invisible barrier to entry is the
TripIt web service, which is designed to
manage travel itineraries. To start using the service simply forward
your existing travel-confirmation emails (airplane, hotel, rental car,
etc.) to <em>plans@tripit.com</em>. Poof, you&#8217;re now using TripIt. The service
creates a temporary account for you, parses your emails, creates a
gorgeous itinerary page, and then sends an email to tell you it&#8217;s
ready. It&#8217;s like a personal assistant instantly showing up, and all
you did was forward a few messages! With almost no effort on your
part, you&#8217;ve been sucked in and are browsing the website as an
involved user. At this point, you&#8217;re willing to create a real service
account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re skeptical about your own product&#8217;s barrier to entry, try
doing some simple tests. Give your software to ordinary humans—both technical and
nontechnical—and observe their first minute or two. You may be
surprised at what you discover.</p>

<h4 id="measure_usage_not_users">Measure Usage, Not Users</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In pondering the size of your user base and whether it&#8217;s easy to get
started, you should also consider how you measure usage. Notice that we said "usage," not "number of installs"—you want a high number of users who
<em>use</em> your product, not a high number of times people <em>download</em>
your product. You&#8217;ll often hear someone say, "Hey, my product has had
3 million downloads—that&#8217;s 3 million happy users!" Wait; back up. How
many of those 3 million users are <em>actually using</em> your software?
That&#8217;s what we mean by "usage."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an extreme example, how many machines is the Unix archive utility
"ar" installed on? Answer: just about every Unix-based OS out there,
including all versions of Linux, Mac OS X, BSD, and so on. And how
many people use that program? How many even know what it is? Here we
have a piece of software with millions of installs but near-zero
usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usage is something that many companies (including Google) spend a lot
of time measuring. Common metrics include "7-day actives" and "30-day
actives"—that is, how many users have used the software in the past
week or month. These are the important numbers that actually tell you
how well your software is doing. Ignore the download counts. Figure
out a way to measure ongoing activity instead.  For example, if your
product is a website or web app, try a product like Google Analytics;
it not only gives you these metrics, but also gives you insight into where
your users came from, how long they stayed, and so on. These are
incredibly useful indicators of product uptake.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2 pagebreak-before">
<h3 id="design_matters">Design Matters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before the Internet came into prominence, the biggest challenge to
getting any product to market was one of distribution. Few companies
had the wherewithal to write a product <em>and</em> get it into thousands of
stores across the world, so when a company put a product out there,
they would then market the hell out of it. This typically resulted in
one or two "winners" in each software category (e.g., Microsoft Word
versus WordPerfect, Excel vs. Lotus 1-2-3, etc.). The primary criteria
you used when choosing a product were features and cost, no matter how
ugly or unintuitive the software was.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That, however, has changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Internet is a global distribution network where it costs almost
nothing to find and download software. And social media makes it easy
for people to share their feelings about various products across the
globe in seconds. The result of these two massive changes (and a host
of other, smaller factors) means that consumers today have a choice of
what product to use. In this highly competitive environment, it&#8217;s no
longer enough to just get a product out there with the necessary
features—your product needs to be beautiful and easy to use. These
days, no amount of marketing will rescue a crappy product, but a
well-designed product that delights the people that use it will turn
these same people into evangelists that market the product <em>for</em> you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So good design is key, but a big part of good design is putting the
user first, hiding complexity, making your product fast, and, most
importantly, not being all things to all people.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="put_the_user_first">Put the User First</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we say to "put the user first," we&#8217;re suggesting that you and
your team should take on whatever hard product work you can to make
using your product easier for your users. This may mean some hard
engineering work, but more frequently it means making hard design
decisions instead of letting your users make these decisions every
time they use your product.  We refer to this as
<em>product laziness</em>. Some would argue that laziness is a virtue for
engineers because it leads to efficient automation of work. On the
other hand, it can be easy to create something that results in great
pain for users. Making software easy for users is one of the greatest challenges
in product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A classic example of this kind of laziness is to present too many
options to your users. People love to make fun of the late-1990s
generation of Microsoft Office
products: button bars! They make every possible menu item instantly
available…for great convenience! User interface designers love to make
fun of this idea, especially when taken to an extreme:</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id044" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_06in06.png" alt="dbtm 06in06">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having too many options is overwhelming. It&#8217;s intimidating and
off-putting. There have even been books written about how too many
choices create anxiety and misery.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_61" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_61" title="View footnote.">61</a>]</sup> You even
need to be careful within your software&#8217;s Preferences dialog. (Did you
know that Eudora, a popular email client, had 30 different panels of
preference values?) And if you&#8217;re making someone fill out a form, be
lenient in what you accept: deal with extra whitespace, punctuation,
or dashes. Don&#8217;t make the user do the parsing! It&#8217;s about respecting
the user&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s really obvious (and infuriating) when a
programmer <em>could</em> have made something friendly and easy for the end
user but didn&#8217;t bother.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="speed_matters">Speed Matters</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most programmers vastly underestimate the importance of <em>application
speed</em> (or <em>latency</em>, which sounds more scientific). Its effects
are both fundamental and <span class="keep-together">profound</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, latency is another type of "barrier to entry."  We&#8217;ve become
spoiled about web page speed. When told to check out a new website, if
it doesn&#8217;t load within three or four seconds, people often abort and
lose interest. There&#8217;s simply no excuse here. The web browser makes
it easy to walk away and redirect our attention to 12 other places. We
have better things to do than wait for a page to load.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, when a program responds quickly, it has a deep subliminal
effect on users. They start using it more and more because it feels
frictionless. It becomes an unconscious extension of their
abilities. On the other hand, a slow application becomes increasingly
frustrating over time. Users start using the software less and less,
often without even realizing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a product launches, it&#8217;s exciting to see usage grow over
time. But after a while the usage often hits a limit—it just sort of
flatlines. This is the point where the marketing folks often step in
and scream about needing more features, prettier colors, nicer fonts,
or more animations that "pop." Sometimes, however, the <em>actual</em>
reason for the stall is latency. The program has become laggy and
frustrating. As the next graph shows, user engagement decreases as
latency increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="image_no_caption-id042" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/dbtm_06in07.png" alt="dbtm 06in07">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>A true story from Google: an engineering team one day released some
dramatic latency improvements to
Google Maps. There was no announcement, no blog
post; the launch was completely secret and silent. Yet the activity
graph showed a huge (and permanent) jump in usage within the first
couple of days. There&#8217;s some powerful psychology going on
there!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even small improvements in latency matter when you&#8217;re serving a
web-based application. Suppose it takes 750
milliseconds for your main application screen to load. That seems fast
enough, right? Not too frustrating for any given user. But if you
could slash your load times to 250 milliseconds, that extra half of a
second makes a huge difference in aggregate. If you have a million
users each doing 20 requests per day, that amounts to <em>116 years</em> of
saved user time—stop killing your users! Improving latency is one of
the best ways to increase usage and make your users happy. As Google&#8217;s
founders like to say, "Speed is a feature."</p>

<h4 id="dont_try_to_be_all_things">Don&#8217;t Try To Be All Things</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is your software
trying to accomplish too much? This sounds like a silly question at
first, but some of the worst software out there is bad because it&#8217;s
overly ambitious. It tries to be absolutely everything to
everyone. Some of the best software succeeds because it defines the
problem narrowly and solves it well. Instead of solving every problem
badly, it solves really common problems for <em>most</em> users and does it
really well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We often joke about certain gadgets we see in magazine ads: hey, look,
it&#8217;s a camping lantern, with a built-in weather radio!…and, uh, also
a built-in TV, and um, stopwatch, and alarm clock, and…eh? It&#8217;s a
confusing mess. Instead, think of your software as a simple toaster
oven. Does it cook everything? Absolutely not. But it cooks <em>a lot</em>
of really common food and is useful to almost everyone who encounters
it without being overwhelming. Be the toaster oven. Less is more.</p>

<h4 id="hide_complexity">Hide Complexity</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"But my software is complex," you may think, "and it&#8217;s solving a
complex problem. So why should I try to hide that?" That&#8217;s a
reasonable concern, but it&#8217;s also one of the central challenges of
good product design. An elegant design makes easy things easy and
hard things possible. Even when doing complex things your software
should <em>feel</em> seamless and easy. (Again, we&#8217;re focusing on the
user&#8217;s <span class="keep-together">emotions</span>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what we like to call "hiding the complexity." You take a
complex problem and break it up, cover it, or do something to make the
software seem simple anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Look at Apple again. Apple&#8217;s product design is
legendary, and one of the cleverest things it did was to creatively
tackle the problem of managing MP3 music collections. Before iPods
came along, there were a handful of awkward gizmos that tried to
manage music right on the portable device. Apple&#8217;s genius was to
realize that MP3 management was too difficult a problem to solve on a
tiny screen, so it <em>moved</em> the solution to a big computer. iTunes
was the answer. You use your computer (with big screen, keyboard, and
mouse) to manage your music collection, and then use the iPod <em>only</em>
for playback. The iPod can then be simple and elegant, and organizing
your music is no longer frustrating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google Search is another well-known example of
hiding complexity. Google&#8217;s interface (and barrier to entry) is almost
nonexistent: it&#8217;s just a magic box to type in. Yet behind that box,
there are thousands of machines across the planet responding in
parallel and doing a search after <em>every keystroke</em> you type. By the
time you hit Enter, the search results have already rendered on your
screen. The amount of technology behind that text box is jaw-dropping,
and yet the complexity of the problem
is hidden from the user. It behaves like
Magic.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_62" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_62" title="View footnote.">62</a>]</sup>
This is a great goal for a creative team to pursue since it&#8217;s
essentially the epitome of product usability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we should mention a caveat about complexity. While masking complexity is laudable, it is <em>not</em> a goal to seal the
software so tight that it ends up handcuffing all your
users. Hiding complexity almost always
involves creating clever abstractions, and as a programmer you need to
assume that the abstractions will eventually "leak." When a web
browser prints a 404 error, that&#8217;s a leaked
abstraction; the illusion is cracked. Don&#8217;t panic, though—it&#8217;s better
to assume that abstractions are leaky and simply embrace them by
providing deliberate ways to lift the curtain. A great way to do this
is to provide APIs to other programmers. Or for really advanced users,
create an "expert mode" that provides more options and choices for
those who want to bypass the abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only is it important to keep the interface flexible and circumventable, but the user&#8217;s data needs to be accessible as well. Fitz put
a great deal of passion into making sure Google products offer "data
liberation"—that it&#8217;s trivial for a user to export his data from an
application and walk away. Software shouldn&#8217;t lock users in, no matter
how elegant the interface is. Allowing users to open the hood and
do whatever they want with their data forces you to compete
honestly: people use your software because they <em>want</em> to, not
because they&#8217;re trapped. It&#8217;s about engendering trust, which (as we&#8217;ll
mention) is your most sacred resource.</p>

<h3 id="managing_your_relationship_with_users">Managing Your Relationship with Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, so your product is appealing on first sight. It&#8217;s easy to get
started. And once people begin, it&#8217;s really pleasant. What happens
months down the line? How do you interact with people who use your
product every day, for years at a time?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Believe it or not, many users <em>want</em> to have a relationship with
your company or team. Happy users want to know what&#8217;s going on with
your software&#8217;s evolution; angry users want a place to complain. One
of the biggest mistakes programmers make is to toss software over a
wall and then stop listening to feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like <em>marketing</em>, the term <em>customer service</em> also typically has
a negative connotation. A career in "customer service" often conjures
up an image of a barista working at a coffee shop or a room full of
robotic people answering support calls. But in reality, customer
service isn&#8217;t a nasty, soul-draining task; nor is it something that
other people (with lesser job descriptions) do. It&#8217;s a philosophy to
live by—a way of thinking about your ongoing connection to users. It&#8217;s
something you need to do proactively as a creative team, not as a mere
reaction to external complaints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Engineers often dread direct interactions with users. "Users are
clueless," they think. "They&#8217;re annoying and impossible to talk to."
And while nobody&#8217;s requiring you to shower every user with love, the simple fact
is that <em>users want to be heard</em>. Even if they make inane
suggestions or clueless complaints, the most important thing you can
possibly do is <em>acknowledge</em> them. The more you allow them to
participate in the discussion and development process, the more loyal
and happy they&#8217;ll be. You don&#8217;t have to agree with them, but you still
need to listen. This is the "Respect" in HRT!  Companies are rapidly
learning this in the age of social media—just reaching out to someone
as a human and not as a giant, faceless corporation is often enough to
alleviate that person&#8217;s concerns. People love it when corporations
openly display HRT.</p>

<p>We like to illustrate the importance of managing users over time by drawing another simple
(slightly unscientific) graph. As time goes on, your software gains

<p>The problem here is that as the number of users increases, their
average level of technical ability <em>decreases</em>, because you&#8217;re
covering more and more of the general population. Pair this up with
ever-increasing complexity and you&#8217;ve got a serious issue with users'
despair:</p>

<img src="images/dbtm_06in11.png" alt="dbtm 06in11">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>More despair means more complaints, angrier users, and an
ever-increasing need for open communication with the software
developers!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What can you do to avoid this trend?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin, don&#8217;t be in denial about the problem.  Many corporations
instinctively do everything they can to put up walls of bureaucracy
between programmers and users. They create voicemail trees to navigate
through or file complaints as "help tickets" that are tracked by
layers of people who aren&#8217;t actually writing the software. Messages
are relayed only indirectly through these layers, as though direct
contact with the dangerous rabble might endanger developers (or
pointlessly distract them). This is how users end up
feeling ignored and disempowered and how developers end up completely
disconnected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A much better mode of interaction is to directly acknowledge
users. Give them a public bug tracker to complain in and respond to
them directly. Create an email list for them to help one
another. Interact directly with users in social media.  If your
product can be open source, that&#8217;s a huge help as well. The more
"human" you appear to users, the more they trust in the product, and
despair begins to lessen. Be on the lookout for people using your
products in unexpected (and awesome) ways. Only through true dialogue
can you discover what they&#8217;re really doing with your software,
possibly something clever or thrilling.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="dont_be_condescending">Respect Users' Intelligence</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Give users respect by default.  A common misconception that powers our
fear of direct user interaction is the myth that users are
stupid. They&#8217;re not writing the software, after all, so they&#8217;re just
"clueless users," right? When you finally have an opportunity to
interact with them, the most important thing to remember is to avoid
condescension. Being a savvy computer user is <em>not</em> a fair measure
of general intelligence. A lot of brilliant people out there use
computers as a tool and nothing more. They&#8217;re not interested in
debugging or following scientific methods to diagnose a
problem. Remember that most of us have no idea how to take apart and
fix our cars; assuming your users are stupid is akin to an auto
mechanic thinking <em>you</em> are stupid because you don&#8217;t know how to
rebuild a transmission, nor even care how to diagnose a transmission
problem. The car is a black box—you just want to drive. For most
people, the computer (and your software) is a black box, too. Users
don&#8217;t want to participate in the analysis process; they just want to
get some work done. It has nothing to do with
intelligence!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="be_patient">Be Patient</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The corollary, then, is to learn great patience. Most users simply don&#8217;t have the
vocabulary to express their problems succinctly. It takes years of
practice to learn to understand what they&#8217;re saying: just ask anyone
who has tried to provide computer tech support to his parents over the
phone (which is probably most of you reading this book!). Half of the
discussion comprises just trying to agree on the same vocabulary. Many
people don&#8217;t know what a web browser is, thinking it&#8217;s just part of
their computer. They describe applications as actions, or talk about
screen icons as mysterious workflow names. The thing is, even the most
intelligent folks have a knack for creating their own logical universe
(and vocabulary) that explains how computers behave. They begin to
diagnose problems in terms of imaginary taxonomies and rules that
exist only in their minds.</p>

context of <span class="keep-together">HRT—</span>about whether and how you exhibit trust toward your
coworkers. In this case we&#8217;re talking about garnering trust from
users. When a user trusts your team (or your company) it&#8217;s mainly an
emotional state: very few people would ever say, "I trust product X
because of this long list of facts that prove that my relationship
with it carries zero risk." They trust you because the cumulative set
of interactions they&#8217;ve had with you add up to an overall

something helpful or useful, or is responsive, a bit of trust is added
to an imaginary bank account in their minds. When a baker adds a
surprise 13<sup>th</sup> donut to your dozen ("lagniappe," as they call it in
New Orleans), this brings a smile to your face. Over years of dealings
the trust account grows and grows until the mention of your product
brings a warm, fuzzy feeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trust can be dangerous, however, because it can be blown all at
once—just like a bank account can be drained with a single stupid,
impulsive purchase. If your company does something that shows a total
lack of respect for users (even if by accident), the trust bank is
emptied overnight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good example of this is the way Netflix temporarily messed
up its relationship with users in late 2011. Netflix is both a service
for streaming movies over the Internet and also a way for renting DVDs
by postal mail. Over the period of a decade it became increasingly
popular: it was easy, convenient, and novel. The price was cheap. By
early 2011 it had more than 23 million subscribers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point the business folks realized their DVD and streaming
services were really separate businesses with separate profit models,
management needs, and so on. So they decided to start charging for
these businesses separately, raising their monthly fees 60% for some
users. Customers were furious. Then Netflix announced that it
would be splitting into two separate companies for greater clarity and
convenience; to users this simply read as "now you have the annoyance
of two bills to pay instead of one." Realizing they had a PR disaster
on their hands, they then <em>un</em>announced the splitting of the
company, but by that time it was too late. The damage had been
done. Despite a history of continuous growth they lost 800,000
subscribers in the span of three months. They managed to blow most of
a decade&#8217;s worth of trust with just a couple of small moves that
seemed like simple and necessary business decisions, but had little
regard for existing relationships.  (Luckily, they managed to totally
rebuild their bank of trust over the next few years by paying careful
attention to service and content;  they came back even stronger!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trust is your <em>most sacred resource</em>. Watch it carefully. Measure
the size of the bank account. Before every move, think about how it
will affect the bank account. Focus on your long-term image, not
short-term conveniences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like trust, <em>delight</em> is another feeling that can vastly improve
your relationship with users. It&#8217;s a way of increasing that warm,
fuzzy feeling, and making your team seem more human.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have to start by not taking yourself too seriously. Google has a
tradition of making outlandish product announcements on April Fools
Day; for example, one year, every video on the front page of YouTube
caused a "rickroll." Or take a look at
<a class="orm:hideurl" href="http://www.woot.com"><em class="hyperlink">www.woot.com</em></a>. It&#8217;s a daily deal site,
but the advertising copy is full of self-deprecating and quirky humor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try to surprise your users with amazing, wonderful bits of
happiness. (That&#8217;s the definition of delight,
isn&#8217;t it?) Despite Google being a powerhouse of hard computer science,
nothing excites its users more than the occasional "doodle" that
illustrates a holiday or anniversary. It&#8217;s just a tiny bit of artwork
injected into people&#8217;s day and yet it inspires endless letters of
feedback and office watercooler discussions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, a bit of horror can inspire users as well, as long as it&#8217;s
done humorously. A company trying to start a social network once
wanted to encourage new users to upload pictures of themselves;
eventually the company decided to start showing a picture of snarling
Dick Cheney for every user who hadn&#8217;t done so—and
the photo uploads suddenly started pouring in!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding bits of delight and humor—tactfully—goes a long way toward
showing that you&#8217;re actually paying attention to users and care about
your relationship with them.</p>

<h3 id="remember_the_users">Remember the Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve covered a slew of ideas in this chapter, but in the end, it all
boils down to three simple concepts that you can stick in your pocket:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Marketing</dt>
<dd>
<p>Be aware of how people perceive your software; it
determines whether they even try it out.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Product design</dt>
<dd>
<p>If your software isn&#8217;t easy to try, fast, friendly, and
accessible, users will walk away.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Customer service</dt>
<dd>
<p>Proactive engagement with long-term users affects
your software&#8217;s evolution and user
retention.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our day jobs as programmers are so full of distractions—code reviews,
design reviews, fighting with our tools, putting out
production-related fires, triaging bugs—that it&#8217;s easy to forget the
<em>reason</em> we&#8217;re writing software at all. It&#8217;s not for you, or your
team, or your company. It&#8217;s to make life easier for users. It&#8217;s
critical to pay attention to what they&#8217;re thinking and saying about
your product and how they&#8217;re experiencing it over the long run. Your
users are the lifeblood of your software&#8217;s success. You reap what you
sow.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="epilogue">Appendix A: Epilogue</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now it should be pretty clear that most of the advice in our book
isn&#8217;t necessarily specific to product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our stories are essentially about the art of maintaining a healthy,
functional community—<em>any</em> community. You could take our anecdotes,
remove the parts specific to product development, and substitute any
other sort of activity. We could be talking about a neighborhood club,
a church group, a fraternity, or a construction team; the same social
problems exist and the same solutions are applicable. Humans are
unpredictable and tricky to deal with no matter what the
context. Product development has the same community-health issues as
any other group endeavor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, while you&#8217;re out there busily incorporating HRT into your daily
work life, keep in mind that it applies to the rest of your life as
well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Who knows? It&#8217;s possible that our real calling may be in writing
church sermons. But for now we&#8217;ll stick to writing software and
getting the most out of collaboration. And now you have the power to
do that, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="a_final_thought-id001">A Final Thought</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve covered an awful lot of topics in this book. After you close the
cover it may be hard to figure out which parts to embrace in your
daily life. After all, what&#8217;s the point of reading a book like this if
it doesn&#8217;t result in some changes in the way you work? What happens
now?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s keep things simple. If you remember anything at all about our
stories, remember HRT: humility, respect, and trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we explained in the first chapter, these three core traits are the
things that need to underlie every social action you make and every
relationship you <span class="keep-together">cultivate</span>. And if you look carefully you&#8217;ll find that
nearly every social problem stems from a <em>lack</em> of one of these
traits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that HRT applies to all your different "spheres" of
influence. It applies to you before anything else: these traits affect
every individual communication you make. It applies to your team: a
culture based on humility, respect, and trust will spend the most time
coding and the least time infighting. It applies to the way people
lead teams: skilled leaders serve their teams and not the other way
around. HRT also applies to the way you interoperate with and survive
temporary collaborators outside your team, whether they are nice
folks, jerks, or a dysfunctional bureaucracy. And finally, these
principles apply directly to the way you interact with the most
important group of all—the users of your product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you keep HRT at the forefront of the way you work, you&#8217;ll have
greater impact with considerably less effort. We think it&#8217;s the best
way to end up spending the most amount of time doing what you love
(shipping product) and the least amount of time dealing with social
conflicts, bureaucracy, and other human drama.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_11">

A "noisy minority" is usually characterized by one or two people who repeatedly respond to every single post in a thread, refuting every argument that doesn&#8217;t align with theirs. A cursory examination of the thread in question might lead you to believe you&#8217;ve got a tremendous amount of dissent when, in fact, it&#8217;s coming from just one or two disgruntled people.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_31">
<a href="#_footnoteref_31">31</a>. Yet another reason companies shouldn&#8217;t force people into management as part of a career path: if an engineer is able to write reams of great code and has no desire at all to manage people or lead a team, by forcing her into a management or tech lead role you&#8217;re losing a great engineer and gaining a crappy manager.
